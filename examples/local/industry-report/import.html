<h2 id="h2_3">Industry Foreword</h2>
<p class="new-section">On behalf of the Strategy Group we would like to acknowledge the foresight of the former Minister, Senator the Hon Kim Carr, in establishing the Food Processing Industry Strategy Group and thank the current Minister for Industry and Innovation, the Hon Greg Combet, AM MP for his subsequent support.</p>
<p class="body-text">The process involved in the production of this report has demonstrated how well companies, unions, researchers, academics and governments can work together to help secure a more sustainable and robust food processing industry. Our industry makes a very important contribution to the Australian economy, particularly in regional areas through employment, business, investment and service opportunities.</p>
<p class="body-text">Like many Australian manufacturers, the food processing industry has suffered recently from the effects of the high Australian dollar. This has compounded some systemic productivity and cost issues, as well as facilitating cheap imports that have affected some sectors significantly. These issues plus very difficult domestic market conditions have placed significant pressure on many processors, contributing to a number of factory closures and resultant job losses in Victoria, NSW, Queensland and Tasmania.</p>
<p class="body-text">Continuing food protectionism in many countries still acts to prevent food from moving to where it is needed, and stops the market mechanism from sending appropriate signals to food producers. The current low levels of unemployment and the competition for skilled workers, exacerbated to some extent by the demands of the mining sector, are impacting on the food processing sector across Australia, particularly in some rural and regional areas. Competition between the mining sector and other manufacturing industries has made the search for scientists, chemists and engineers particularly challenging. Consultation with the food processing industry has also highlighted ready access to workers in some subsectors as a key challenge for some food processors.</p>
<p class="body-text">Despite this, the food processing industry has consistently accounted for at least 23 per cent of employment in the Australian manufacturing sector. It is Australia&rsquo;s largest manufacturing industry by gross value add, employing nearly 222 800 people currently (excluding tobacco). The industry also exported nearly $17 billion of processed food in 2010-11, or approximately 63 per cent of total Australian food exports.</p>
<p class="body-text">The food processing industry is resilient but times are tough. There are a number of challenges and opportunities for the Australian food processing industry in the immediate future. The challenges include the impact of climate change; declining natural resources such as land and water; food security; a burgeoning human population, estimated by the United Nations to exceed more than nine billion in 2050; and questions regarding whether the growth in population will be accompanied by a necessary growth in incomes. The global decline in food processing research and development is also of concern.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Strategy Group&rsquo;s recommendations to the Australian Government aim to build long-term innovation, investment, productivity and international competitiveness in the food processing industry, and to assist it to respond to the challenges and opportunities ahead.</p>
<p class="body-text">The recommendations are designed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase the level and quality of innovation </li>
<li>Improve access for Australian processed food manufacturers to new markets through a more effective use of Australia&rsquo;s valued brand and a strategic alignment of assets, among other initiatives</li>
<li>Align Australia&rsquo;s innovation and marketing assets behind the food processing sector so that it can take advantage of the Asian Century</li>
<li>Identify regulatory inefficiencies and program duplications that diminish the effectiveness of all stakeholders in the industry, and options to address those inefficiencies and</li>
<li>Provide options to address market place relation issues.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body-text">There is a cultural change needed in the industry here. We have no birthright to win on the world stage and we must invest in innovation, entrepreneurship and our people if we are to do so.</p>
<p class="body-text">We would like to thank the Strategy Chair, Mr Mike Lawson and his predecessor Mr Michael Schwager, for the manner in which they directed the work of the Strategy Group and the production of the report. We are also grateful to the Strategy Group&rsquo;s Secretariat for their assistance over the course of the inquiry.</p>
<p class="body-text">We look forward to the Government&rsquo;s response to our ideas and the future collaboration of business, unions, researchers, academics and government in ensuring a healthy and profitable food processing industry in the decades ahead.</p>

<ol>
<li>Identify the current strengths and weaknesses of industry and any impediments to improving innovation, productivity and competitiveness; </li>
<li>Report to the Minister on opportunities for enhancing/expanding the industry; </li>
<li>Advise the Minister on strategies to overcome impediments including any changes to current programs and market failures not addressed; and </li>

</ol>
<h2 id="h2_5">Vision</h2>
<p class="new-section">An innovative, growing, sustainable, responsive and globally competitive Australian food processing sector.</p>

<h2 id="h2_6">Mission</h2>
<p class="new-section">To provide expert advice and foster a common understanding of the issues facing the food processing sector and develop practical solutions lead by industry to improve innovation, increase growth, employment, productivity and competitiveness in the sector.</p>

<h2 id="h2_7">Executive Summary</h2>

<p class="new-section">Since the Global Financial Crisis and in particular, over the last 12 months, the food processing industry, like other Australian manufacturing industries that are trade-exposed, has been tested by an increasingly competitive environment. A sustained high dollar and a highly concentrated retail environment have placed additional pressures on already modest profit margins. Productivity has been stagnant in many parts of the food chain and there has been an insufficient focus on expanding markets - the result of an industry in survival mode.</p>
<p class="body-text">The industry is by no means homogeneous with over <br/>238 sub-sectors and 13 000 (mainly small) businesses. This means that issues vary, and there is not one magic bullet that can improve productivity or increase demand for each sub-sector.</p>
<p class="body-text">Australia is a comparatively expensive place to do business - labour, land and transport costs are high, with a rigorous regulatory environment which among other things protects consumers. A flow-on effect of these factors is comparatively high food costs. This is a reflection of and a contributor to the relatively egalitarian and high quality of life we Australians enjoy. We have competitive advantages in good-quality, diverse and moderately priced beef, dairy, wheat, sugar and wine.</p>
<p class="body-text">There are low barriers to business entry, so it is relatively easy to start a business. Australia&rsquo;s stable political system and growing economy provides a good foundation for industry.</p>
<p class="body-text">An educated and culturally diverse population means that we have the potential to be successful. Low unemployment and high wages being offered in the resource sector make attracting and retaining skilled staff difficult in some areas. A strong regional base contributes to generally positive labour relations overall. Food manufacturing companies are often major regional employers and they support the communities through employment. The Strategy Group benefited from its membership of both unions and industry, both of which felt that Australia cannot afford to be complacent in that relationship. There is a mutual benefit to companies and employees working together to improve productivity, and in skilling the work force both to maintain in and attract employees to these communities. A greater focus on the fitness for purpose of relevant courses at both certificate level and undergraduate level is needed. Management and business skills are sometimes lacking in smaller companies&rsquo; management; firm-level support provided by governments should be maintained.</p>
<p class="body-text">There is sufficient domestic population growth to sustain the industry, and Australia&rsquo;s population is growing faster than many advanced economies (expected population in 2050 is 33.9 million, although this has been informally revised downwards after the recent Census). Australians are generally proud of their food industry, but this is not enough in itself to guarantee their loyalty to Australian-made and produced food products. Australians demand value (which includes quality) for money, especially in a fragile world economic environment; their preferences are also changing to healthier, more convenient foods.</p>
<p class="body-text">Despite these challenges, the Australian Food Industry has a unique opportunity to capitalise on opportunities in our region. It is critical that Australian manufactured foods ride the wave of the demand for Australian produce from Asia. Asia&rsquo;s incomes as well as its populations are growing, which means that Asians&rsquo; desire for processed foods not just raw ingredients is growing. We export a significant amount of processed foods but the majority is not substantially transformed, reducing the potential benefit to Australians.</p>
<p class="body-text">The phenomenon of working families and dietary changes mean that families of the burgeoning Asian middle-classes too are looking for convenient, safe and healthy food. The Australian brand is a trusted one and provides an ideal starting entry point into these growth markets.</p>
<p class="body-text">Multinationals located in Asia should not be the only beneficiary of the &lsquo;Asian Century&rsquo;. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can collaborate with multinationals, learn from their success and follow in their slipstream. Retailers too can be a vehicle for penetrating growing Asian markets.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Australian brand is a quality hallmark and more can be made of the opportunity to use it both in Australia and overseas. The Strategy Group feels there is merit in industry investigating what works in Asia in terms of Australian branding and how it could be used to assist SMEs and multinationals operating out of Australia to capture Asian markets.</p>
<p class="body-text">The term &lsquo;Made in Australia&rsquo; is misunderstood, and the Strategy Group supports the review of the substantially transformed definitions across legislation to greater reflect public perceptions of this term, especially as a large segment of the Australian community wants to support Australian jobs and farmers.</p>
<p class="body-text">There are insights that can come from Australia&rsquo;s increasingly diverse population and we need to understand the dietary differences and preferences of our key markets. Without extensive investment in market research, small businesses cannot hope to have the insight into these needs. Partnerships are needed, with either each other or multinationals, to understand and enter these markets.</p>
<p class="body-text">More strategic engagement with Austrade is needed. Firms can be assisted to determine whether they are export ready, and successful exporters can provide leadership and know-how. There is a need for greater coordination to tap into a mammoth Asian market through networks and solid distribution channels. The Government will continue to focus on reducing tariffs for processed foods including through Free Trade Agreement negotiations. Australian Governments should also continue to help businesses that are trying to expand their markets by assisting them with regulatory design that minimises trade barriers.</p>
<p class="body-text">Australia has outstanding research capabilities in food-related areas especially in its major public research organisation Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and universities, particularly those that are in receipt of Australian Research Council funding. Stronger linkages between industry and these institutions, and greater prioritisation from industry and policy-makers, are needed. Research is needed to help reduce input cost and quality inconsistencies, improve production processes, reduce wastage, extend shelf-lives and produce healthier ingredients.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Strategy Group has recommended creation of a Food Innovation Hub/Network to act as a catalyst for more collaboration between researchers and industry; improve industry capabilities especially SMEs; assist with information failures related to supply chains; improve insights (especially into Asia); and attract foreign investment. Governed by four key stakeholders - academia, governments, industry and researchers, it can help deliver greater insight, oversight and prioritisation of food research; improve commercialisation from research; attract more talent to the industry; better coordinate strategic market incursions with Austrade; and help to understand better the behind-the-border barriers to entry into these markets.</p>
<p class="body-text">Our regulatory system has given us a unique advantage in terms of food safety. Over the years the Commonwealth, States and Territories, and New Zealand have come together to try to reduce inconsistencies in the regulatory landscape. However, more can be done to reduce inconsistencies and remove ineffective, overlapping or unnecessary regulation. The mantra must be &lsquo;minimum effective regulation&rsquo; based on evidence of market failure. This, plus a commitment to the Regulatory Impact Statement process, is needed to maintain quality and safety while improving productivity. The Strategy Group believes strongly that the Commonwealth should assume powers from the States in the areas of regulation common with New Zealand, to remove inconsistencies and remove potential incentives for manufacturers to relocate to other countries.</p>
<p class="body-text">The regulation of emerging technologies, such as gene technology and nanotechnology, is based on science. Governments and scientists should show leadership in communicating the benefits of applying these emerging technologies in food production, emphasising the sound scientific evidence upon which their use is regulated.</p>
<p class="body-text">Support for business from governments needs to be better coordinated - the hub and network could act as a coordinating point for support along the entire food chain.</p>
<p class="body-text">The industry needs to continue to work together to limit the effect of its own imposts, such as Quality Assurance systems, where there is significant overlap and cost. At the same time it could look at risks in its own supply chain systems to better improve traceability and assurance.</p>
<p class="body-text">There are benefits of small increases in productivity through the value chain multiplying exports. Distance to large markets means high transport costs reduce our competitiveness. Port, road and rail infrastructure need to be efficient and effective, but this is a common requirement for the entire manufacturing sector and food chain. Industry needs to continue to build on its efforts to improve product and raw material consistency, emerging technologies, extending shelf-lives and reducing waste.</p>
<p class="body-text">The report was developed during a period when a number of allegations had been made against retailers regarding misuse of market power and unconscionable conduct. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is currently investigating these complaints expeditiously.</p>
<p class="body-text">Without diminishing the effect of these complaints, the Strategy Group felt the best path for the moment was a new pact between the industry and the retail sector - appreciating each other&rsquo;s pressures and strengths. The retail sector needs a healthy, innovative and quality supply chain, and the manufacturers want fair access to the consumer and fair terms of trade. If the retail sector has aspirations of entering Asia, it will want a solid supply base. All parts of the supply chain must find productivity improvements to deliver benefits to the consumer. Profits must be sufficient to allow for reinvestment in capital and innovation. Short-term thinking benefits few in the longer term. Small and medium manufacturers must have an opportunity to thrive and innovate with a degree of independence. To this end the Strategy Group has recommended all parties cooperate to review the Produce and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct. Government intervention through regulation is only recommended should this fail to improve productivity and competition in the market, and as a last resort.</p>
<p class="body-text">Without a sufficient level of scale, small and medium companies cannot hope to enter foreign markets. Even large manufacturers find themselves increasingly small compared to the scale of overseas plants, hence making them uncompetitive. Collaborations by businesses within an industry to collectively negotiate terms with common suppliers, or merger activities, can potentially raise competition concerns. The Competition and Consumer Act 2010 contains provisions which allow businesses to seek ACCC authorisation to collaborate and achieve scale provided there is sufficient public benefit. Measures should be taken to improve industry awareness of these provisions. Governments also need to ensure barriers to entry for new players in the industry - both retailers and manufacturers - are low to ensure competition.</p>
<p class="body-text">There must be enough profit incentives for companies to reinvest in Australia, especially in replacing out of date, unscaled plant and equipment. The Strategy Group recommends accelerated depreciation should be targeted to these items to ensure productivity gains rather than cars and office equipment, a point recently acknowledged and prioritised by the Prime Minister at the Prime Minister&rsquo;s economic forum held in Brisbane in mid-June 2012.</p>
<p class="body-text">The industry must imagine a different future for itself, focused on long-term strategic engagement with our Asian neighbours. Manufacturers, unions, academia and research institutes must work together with governments to capitalise on its strengths and opportunities.</p>
<p class="body-text">There are significant opportunities for driving growth and competitiveness in Australia&rsquo;s food processing industry. Critical to this success will be effective partnerships between business, unions, government and research communities. The Food Innovation Hub/Network would be a catalyst for enhanced collaboration which would assure the future of the industry.</p>

<h3 id="h3_1">Recommendations</h3>
<p class="body-text">The industry transformation strategies and recommendations for the Australian processed food industry are informed by four main themes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>New markets and the Australian brand </li>
<li>Regulatory reform and program efficiencies</li>
<li>Marketplace relations</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h3_2">Innovation</h3>
<p class="body-text"><b>Recommendation 1</b> - Industry, governments, research institutes and universities collaborate to create a Food Innovation Hub/Network, incorporating a strategic planning and intelligence function, and a virtual network.</p>
<p class="body-text"><b>Recommendation 2</b> - Industry to develop proposals to utilise the Australian Research Council (ARC) Competitive Grants Program, particularly Linkage Funding Schemes, the proposed Food Innovation Hub/Network, and work with universities and the VET sector to promote current R&amp;D and food industry courses.</p>

<h3 id="h3_3">New Markets and Australian Brand</h3>
<p class="body-text"><b>Recommendation 3</b> - Government to provide assistance and information that will facilitate exports and firm-level information be used to help match businesses to export opportunities.</p>
<p class="body-text"><b>Recommendation 4</b> - Consideration be given to regulatory clarification to define substantial transformation in relation to food products, taking into consideration consumer perceptions of meaning of the term &lsquo;Australian Made&rsquo; and Australia&rsquo;s international obligations. Industry and Government to test the reputation of Australian food in Asian markets and investigate the most appropriate brand mark for Australian products in the various Asian markets. An Asia Pacific marketing campaign to be developed by Industry to promote Australian processed foods.</p>

<h3 id="h3_4">Regulatory reform and program efficiencies</h3>
<p class="body-text"><b>Recommendation 5</b> - Taking into account the analysis and recommendations from the Productivity Commission study: Performance Benchmarking of Australian and New Zealand Business Regulation: Food Safety (December 2009), the Government review regulatory arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States, in particular undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the Commonwealth taking over regulation of food processing and safety.</p>
<p class="body-text"><b>Recommendation 6</b> - Government to identify all programs at Commonwealth and state level and to identify opportunities to improve the business design of such programs to ensure that they complement each other and are delivered more efficiently.</p>
<p class="body-text"><b>Recommendation 7</b> - Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC) convene a forum to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the current level of quality assurance (QA) auditing of the processed food industry and to develop recommendations on alternative QA options that reduce the regulatory burden on business - retail and manufacturing - without compromising food standards.</p>
<p class="body-text"><b>Recommendation 8</b> - Governments develop a statement explaining their approach to the use of emerging technologies in food, which supports the safe development and application of emerging technologies.</p>

<h3 id="h3_5">Marketplace Relations</h3>
<p class="body-text"><b>Recommendation 9</b> - The food processing industry, together with the retailers, to review the Produce and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct (PGICC) to see if it is fit for purpose or if an enhanced PGICC and/or stronger role for the Ombudsman is required to effect behavioural change in the retail sector.</p>
<p class="body-text"><b>Recommendation 10</b> - Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education (DIISRTE) will work, in consultation with the ACCC, with industry bodies to increase industry awareness of the authorisations process for mergers and collective bargaining under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA) as a means of achieving economies of scale and cost reductions through mergers, acquisitions, asset sharing, and collective bargaining.</p>
<h2 id="h2_8">1. Introduction</h2>

<p class="new-section">On 24 January 2011, the then Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator the Hon Kim Carr, announced the establishment of the Food Processing Industry Strategy Group, bringing together key representatives of Australia&rsquo;s food manufacturing industry, the union movement, the scientific community, academia and government.</p>
<p class="body-text">In his announcement Senator Carr noted the importance of the food processing industry, Australia&rsquo;s largest manufacturing sector. He made reference to &lsquo;a time of change&rsquo;, a need to step up to the new responsibilities for the future of the food processing sector. He indicated that the formation of the Strategy Group would provide a clearer assessment of the impact of our research and development investments on the sector and build new capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="h3_6">1.1 The Scope of This Report</h3>
<p class="body-text">The report recognises the important role played by the food processing industry in Australia. It is a vital component of the economy and was Australia&rsquo;s largest manufacturing industry in 2010-11, accounting for nearly 22 per cent of manufacturing gross value added. In 2008-09 the Australian processed food and beverage industry spent around $427.8 million on research and development, of which $421.2 million was business-funded. Australia&rsquo;s net processed food exports were $6.54 billion in 2010-11.</p>
<p class="body-text">The industry also makes a significant contribution to regional communities through employment, business, investment and service opportunities. It consistently accounts for at least 23 per cent of employment in the Australian manufacturing sector; in May 2012 employment in the industry was approximately 222 800 (excluding tobacco).</p>
<p class="body-text">The viability of the industry is inextricably linked to the price of raw materials and other input costs, a fact that has been emphasised in the numerous inquiries that have been held into the industry over the past few decades. The report attempts to build on the results of these earlier inquiries, acknowledging in some cases, how little has changed.</p>
<p class="body-text">Despite its success, the food processing industry is currently subject to structural change and a range of challenges. These have placed pressure on it to develop proactive strategies if it is to flourish in the longer term, especially by engaging with burgeoning Asian markets.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Strategy Group&rsquo;s approach has been to focus on direct and practical solutions designed to enhance prosperity and productivity of all those involved in the sector through increased levels of innovation and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="body-text">While the Strategy Group has attempted to tailor its recommendations to the Industry and Innovation portfolio, it has not hesitated to comment on other portfolio&rsquo;s policy areas where these have resulted in barriers for the industry. In the main the Strategy Group&rsquo;s ideas are practical and cost-neutral.</p>
<p class="body-text">Consistent with the Strategy Group&rsquo;s Mission Statement, a key long-term aim of the work of the Strategy Group has been to assist the food processing industry to become self-sufficient in investment, innovation, and collaboration, and in determining its own long-term strategic direction. This is in line with the policy of the Government to intervene only where there has been market failure, and where the benefits of such an intervention can be demonstrated to outweigh the costs and be in the public interest.</p>
<p class="body-text">In general the Strategy Group&rsquo;s approach has been to address aggregated sectoral issues rather than those faced by discrete sub-sectors. This is because of the complexity and diversity of the industry with over 13 015 businesses, of which 12 823 are small and medium-sized enterprises as at June 2011 - covering ten Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) groups and 238 classes.</p>
<p class="body-text">The review recognises that Australian food and beverage manufacturers may continue to struggle with the high value of the Australian dollar for the foreseeable future, and that Australia will remain a comparatively small market with high input costs in a number of areas. The Strategy Group remains optimistic about the long-term viability of the industry and believes that Governments have a critical role in driving innovation and helping to reduce the cost of doing business.</p>

<h3 id="h3_7">1.2 Past Government Involvement</h3>
<p class="body-text">Australian Governments have traditionally sought to develop a more competitive and sustainable food processing sector and to increase innovation and investment in the industry. The food processing industry has been the subject of numerous government initiatives, policies and strategies over the past decade. The most significant Commonwealth Government Food Programs (1992-2012) are at <a href="#h3_35"><b>Appendix A</b></a>.</p>
<p class="body-text">In 1988 an Industries Assistance Commission report indicated that Australia&rsquo;s food regulation system was impeding the development of an efficient and competitive export industry, and was constraining the adoption of emerging technologies and product innovation because of inherent costs and impediments. <sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fnr_1">1</a></sup> This report provided an incentive for government action by numerous federal governments over the subsequent decades.</p>
<p class="body-text">In 1992 the Commonwealth Government oversaw the establishment of an Agri-Food Council (AFC). The objectives of the AFC included increasing the access of Australian agri-food companies to the Asian market, improving freight distribution, and improving packaging.<sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fnr_2">2</a></sup> The Agri-Food Industry Program received funding of $9.9 million over five years.</p>
<p class="body-text">In 1996 Prime Minister John Howard replaced the AFC with the Supermarket to Asia (STA) program.<sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fnr_3">3</a></sup> This, in turn, was terminated in 2002 and replaced with the National Food Industry Initiative.<sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fnr_4">4</a></sup> A five-year National Food Industry Strategy (NFIS) operated from 2002-07.</p>
<p class="body-text">In 2007 the Commonwealth Government announced a revamping of the NFIS to continue its support of the industry with funding of $75.7 million over four years. The four programs under the NFIS were administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF). They included:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Food Innovation Grants Program ($54.2 million) </li>
<li>the Technical Market Access Program ($15.0 million) </li>
<li>the International Food Standards Initiative ($2.5 million) </li>
<li>Australian Food Industry Council ($4.0 million).</li>
</ul>

<p class="body-text">From 2008 to 2010 government support for industry innovation decreased, primarily as a result of completion of the Food Innovation Grant (FIG) scheme. This scheme was replaced by the Regional Food Producers Innovation and Productivity Program (RFPIPP).<sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fnr_5">5</a></sup> The four-year, $35 million RFPIPP was established to boost the productivity and competitiveness of Australia&rsquo;s regional food and seafood industries through innovation and technology improvements. The program is due to end on 30 June, 2012.</p>
<p class="body-text">Numerous reports and recommendations have accompanied these programs and strategies. In addition, the Australian Parliament has actively examined a range of food industry issues. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Senate Economics References Committee Inquiry into the Food Standards Amendment (Truth in Labelling Laws) Bill 2009</li>
<li>Senate Economics References Committee Milking it for all it&rsquo;s worth - competition and pricing in the Australian dairy industry 2010</li>
<li>Senate Agricultural and Related Industries, Select Food Production in Australia 2010</li>
<li>Senate Economics References Committee Interim report: The impacts of supermarket price decisions on the dairy industry (presented out of session on 20 April 2011)</li>
<li>House of Representatives Economics Committee Food Standards Amendment (Truth in Labelling - Palm Oil) Bill 2011</li>
<li>House Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry Competition and Consumer Amendment (Horticulture Code of Conduct) Bill 2011</li>
<li>Senate Select Committee on Australia&rsquo;s Food Processing Sector 2012 (current).</li>
</ul>

<p class="body-text">The Senate Select Committee on Australia&rsquo;s Food Processing Sector is due to report in 2012 on matters including the viability and competitiveness of, and the regulatory environment for, Australia&rsquo;s food processing sector. The terms of reference for the inquiry specifically address matters such as Government regulations regarding labelling and taxation in the context of food processing and manufacturing.</p>

<h3 id="h3_8">1.3 Current Government Initiatives</h3>
<p class="body-text">In Australia, the main agents for transfer of locally developed technology are the universities, and public research organisations (PRO) such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). However, the Commonwealth Government has provided a number of incentives for companies to engage in innovation and research, as well as other programs to encourage investment and develop business skills. In addition to those current programs mentioned in <a href="#h3_35"><b>Appendix A</b></a>, some initiatives are outlined below.</p>

<h5>The Research and Development (R&amp;D) Tax Incentive</h5>
<p class="body-text">The Research and Development (R&amp;D) Tax Concession was introduced in 1985 to encourage Australian industry to undertake more research and development activities. During the period from 26 November 2007 to 30 September 2010, 642 food-related companies registered for the R&amp;D Tax Concession. The concession was a broad-based and market-driven program that enabled companies to deduct up to 125 per cent of eligible expenditure incurred on R&amp;D activities when lodging their income tax returns. Interestingly, in the period 2000 to early 2011, many subsectors where Australia enjoys a competitive advantage were least successful in attaining the R&amp;D tax concession, e.g. dairy; sugar and wine.</p>
<p class="body-text">The R&amp;D Tax Incentive replaced the R&amp;D Tax Concession from 1 July 2011, and officially became law on 8 September 2011. It provides targeted tax offsets to encourage more Australian businesses to engage in R&amp;D activities, and is open to all businesses in all industry sectors.</p>
<p class="body-text">There are two new components of the program, which aim to provide greater financial benefits for eligible R&amp;D activities. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a 45 per cent R&amp;D refundable tax offset to eligible entities with an aggregated turnover of less than $20 million</li>
<li>a non-refundable 40 per cent R&amp;D tax offset to all other eligible entities.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body-text">The program is jointly administered by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) and AusIndustry.</p>

<h5>Australian Research Council (ARC)</h5>

<p class="body-text">The ARC was established by the Australian Research Council Act 2001. It is a statutory authority under the Public Service Act 1999 and a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.</p>
<p class="body-text">In 2010-11 the ARC had a total operating budget of $20.895 million, with additional administered funding of $5.728 million for implementation of the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) initiative. The ARC has also received $2.574 million to fund IT systems to support the ERA initiative.</p>
<p class="body-text">The ARC administers the Australian Government&rsquo;s National Competitive Grants Program (NCGP). In 2010-11 NCGP funding was estimated to total around $708.733 million. Together with the ERA funding, this accounted for 7.9 per cent of the Australian Government&rsquo;s 2010-11 $8.923 billion commitment to science and innovation.</p>
<p class="body-text">Through the NCGP the ARC is currently administering funding provided to almost 4650 research projects Australia-wide, involving more than 10 200 researchers.</p>

<h5>The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS)</h5>
<p class="body-text">The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) is a $542m, seven-year strategy spanning from 2004-05 to 2010-11. NCRIS provides and supports major research infrastructure, allowing Australia to conduct world-class research. In November 2006, twelve priority areas (capabilities) were announced, and projects have since been funded in each of these areas.</p>
<p class="body-text">In 2009-10, the Department conducted an evaluation of the NCRIS Program. The assessment concluded that the NCRIS model is appropriate for funding medium- to large-scale, capability-based research infrastructure and has been effective in meeting research infrastructure needs.</p>
<p class="body-text">The <i>Strategic Roadmap for Australian Research Infrastructure</i> was released in September 2011 and further develops Australia&rsquo;s research capacity and improves innovation and research outcomes over the next five to ten years.</p>

<h5>Commercialisation Australia</h5>
<p class="body-text">Commercialisation Australia is a merit-based, competitive assistance program delivered by the Australian Government that provides a new, integrated, hands-on approach to take products, processes and services to market by offering a range of tailored assistance measures for specialist advice and services, proof of concept and early stage commercialisation activities.</p>
<p class="body-text">Commercialisation Australia has funding of $278 million over the five years to 2014, with ongoing funding of $82 million a year thereafter.</p>

<h5>Enterprise Connect</h5>

<p class="body-text">The Enterprise Connect Food Processing Industry Support Network is a specialised national group. It brings together business advisers with specialist expertise and networks, and helps Australian businesses in the food processing sector which transform products for consumers, and other up-stream processors. It is targeted at improving operations, productivity, competitiveness and sustainability by providing professional business advice, development services and linkages.</p>

<h5>National Food and Nutrition Leaders&rsquo; Science Forum (NFNLSF)</h5>
<p class="body-text">The National Food and Nutrition Leaders Science Forum (NFNLSF), supported by the CSIRO, was established by Government in 2011 within the Primary Industries Standing Committee (PISC) framework. The NFNLSF&rsquo;s mechanism is to facilitate better coordination of activities and information sharing between Research, Development and Technology Transfer (RD&amp;TT) participants, and to link industry, research providers and investors and other relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p class="body-text">The R&amp;D Strategy being developed by the NFNLSF aims to identify the key challenges and develop R&amp;D priorities for the food and nutrition sector to meet the future needs of the industry and government, including a plan for implementation. The Strategy will be integrated with current initiatives and other agricultural Research and Development Extension (RD&amp;E) sectoral and cross-sectoral strategies under the umbrella of the National RD&amp;E framework. The main aim of this framework is to develop a more coordinated and collaborative approach to rural RD&amp;E, and ensure national research capability will be focused, used efficiently and effectively to achieve the best outcome and uptake by industry.</p>

<h5>Clean Technology Food and Foundries Program</h5>
<p class="body-text">The <i>Clean Technology - Food and Foundries Investment Program</i> provides up to $150 million over six years to food and beverage manufacturers to invest in energy-efficient equipment and low-pollution technologies, processes and products.</p>
<p class="body-text">A merit-based grants program, it will assist the Australian food and beverage manufacturers to maintain competitiveness in a carbon-constrained economy. The grant assistance available is dependent on the size of the grant and the turnover of the applicant.</p>
<h5>Cooperative Research Centres</h5>
<p class="body-text">The Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) program was established in 1991, with a focus on delivering economic, environmental and social benefits to Australia. In particular, the program is aimed at developing partnerships between researchers and end users to address issues.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research is responsible for the CRC program. The CRC committee, appointed by the Minister, oversees a merit-based application process, monitoring, and evaluation of the program, with particular emphasis on aligning CRC projects with appropriateness for funding. CRCs have played a role in developing solutions for the food industry, a list of food related CRCs can be found at <a href="#h3_35"><b>Appendix A</b></a>.</p>

<h5>State and Territory programs</h5>

<p class="body-text">Each State and Territory, and in some cases, discrete areas within a State (e.g. the Gippsland Food Plan) deliver programs, initiatives and assistance tailored to region-specific needs. While it cannot be argued that these programs do not provide benefit to the industry there does seem to be a lack of integration, coordination and integrated design between the different levels of government in some cases.</p>

<h3 id="h3_9">1.4 National Food Plan</h3>

<p class="body-text">The Australian Government committed to developing a national food plan during the 2010 election. The development of the food plan involved a community discussion about Australia&rsquo;s food and the issues affecting it. An issues paper was released in June 2011 and public consultations followed.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Issues paper noted that there are currently many government policies, programs and regulations to address food-related policy issues. However, no overarching food policy framework exists.</p>
<p class="body-text">The development of a national food plan aims to integrate food policy along the whole food supply chain - from paddock to plate. The plan will acknowledge the important role played by State, Territory and local governments in monitoring the supply and consumption of food.</p>
<p class="body-text">On 17 July 2012, Minister Ludwig released the National Food Plan Green Paper. The Green Paper will provide stakeholders with a chance to contribute further through written submissions and public consultations being conducted from July 2012 to 30 September 2012. The Strategy Group&rsquo;s Report will feed into the development of the National Food Plan White Paper.</p>

<h3 id="h3_10">1.5 Food Processing Industry Strategy Group Activities</h3>

<p class="body-text">The Food Processing Industry Strategy Group comprises 16 representatives from the processed food industry covering multinationals and the small business community, key representatives from the trade union sector, research and academia. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) had observer status.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Strategy Group was originally chaired by Michael Schwager, Head of the Industry and Small Business Policy Division. Following an internal department restructure, the new Chair was Mike Lawson, Head of the Manufacturing Division, Australian Government Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education (DIISRTE). There were two Deputy Chairs: Ms Rebecca-Dee Bradbury, Chief Executive Officer of Kraft Foods Australia New Zealand, and Ms Jennifer Dowell, National Secretary, Food and Confectionary Division, Australian Manufacturing Workers&rsquo; Union. A full list of members is at <a href="#h3_36"><b>Appendix B</b></a>.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Strategy Group has been supported by a small secretariat within DIISRTE.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Strategy Group met on six occasions. The secretariat also had bilateral discussions with member&rsquo;s out-of-session and working groups also met to brainstorm and develop recommendations proposed within the report.</p>
<p class="body-text">As part of the preparation of the report, it was necessary to assemble data and information on the industry to assist the Strategy Group in its review. The Strategy Group engaged consultants to:</p>

<ul>
<li>collect specific data, e.g. access to a food innovation web site</li>
<li>conduct an industry survey of the food processing industry to gain insight into issues </li>
<li>conduct studies on competitiveness issues relating to the high volume, low value add Australian flour and food oil sectors</li>
<li>conduct a review of the food packaging sector and </li>
<li>plan scenarios, using a Centre for International Economics (CIE) economic modelling tool developed in collaboration with the CSIRO.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body-text">The Strategy Group completed a high-level analysis to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the industry, examined the impediments to the industry&rsquo;s future development and has proposed strategies through which those impediments may be overcome.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Strategy Group also developed Group and Industry Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - see <a href="#h3_37"><b>Appendix C</b></a>.</p>
<p class="body-text">This final report by the Strategy Group addresses the key challenges confronting the Australian food processing industry and makes practical recommendations to industry and governments to promote and increase levels of innovation, productivity and competitiveness in the sector.</p>

<h2 id="h2_9">2. Economic Contribution of the Food Processing Sector</h2>

<p>This chapter describes the significance, the structure and economic performance of Australia's food processing industry and the global food industry. This chapter provides an initial context for the following two chapters but also underpins key themes and the recommendations in <a href="#h2_12"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></a>, especially the current and future importance of innovation and new markets.</p>
<p>Industry gross value added by the Australian food, beverage and tobacco processing sector was $23.6 billion in 2010-11, which represented approximately 22 per cent of the gross value added of the Australian manufacturing industry and 1.9 per cent of Australian gross domestic product. The food and beverage processing industry also accounted for nearly 24 per cent of Australian manufacturing sector employment in 2010-11. The value of Australian food exports increased to $27.1 billion in 2010-11. Processed foods represent approximately 63 per cent or nearly $17 billion of total food exports for 2010-11.<sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fnr_6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Between 2010 and 2012 closures of food processing plants occurred across Australia. In May 2012, Murray Goulburn, one of the biggest exporters of processed dairy foods in Australia, announced 301 redundancies following a detailed review of its processing sites and head office requirements. Goodman Fielder also announced over 300 redundancies in the first half of the 2011-12 financial year. A number of firms, such as Heinz and McCain, have also moved their processing plants offshore to New Zealand or Asia. These events have to be also balanced against some significant investments in recent times, such as Coca-Cola Amatil's $57 million investment in a bottle-manufacturing plant in New South Wales and Primo Smallgoods' investment in a new manufacturing and distribution facility in Wacol just outside of Brisbane.</p>
<p>Industry feedback suggests that the last nine months have seen a deterioration of poor trading conditions, although the evidence of this is patchy. It is anticipated that a number of factors may contribute to further food and other manufacturing plant closures in the next few years, although industry statistics may not necessarily forewarn of these potential events currently due to statistical time-lag issues.</p>
<h3 id="h3_11">2.1 Structure of the Australian Food Industry</h3>
<h4 id="h4_1">2.1.1 Industry value chain</h4>
<p>The Australian food industry encompasses many sectors - from production of raw materials used in food (the farm and fishing sectors) through to the export, import and processing sectors, and ultimately, to domestic sales to consumers. The key components of the food supply chain in 2010-11 are shown in <strong><a href="#fig_2-1">Figure 2.1</a>.</strong></p>
<p id="fig_2-1">Figure 2.1: Value Chain for Food in Australia, 2010-11</p>
<p><img src="./images/fig_006.jpg" alt="Five illustrations of pie chart depicting the Value Chain for Food in Australia, 2010-11." /></p>
<p>Source: Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2012, <em>Australian Food Statistics: 2010-11</em><br /><a href="#des_1">Text description for Value Chain for Food in Australia, 2010-11</a></p>
<p>The value of food and liquor retailing in Australia grew by 3.7 per cent in 2010-11 to $130.4 billion. Supermarket and grocery store expenditure continued to account for the bulk of food retailing expenditure in 2010-11, with a share of 62 per cent, down from 63 per cent in the previous year. The total value of Australian farm and fisheries food production grew by 17 per cent in 2010-11 to $40.7 billion.</p>
<p>Australian food exports (unprocessed and processed foods) increased to $27.1 billion in 2010-11 - $2.6 billion higher than in 2009-10. The value of Australian food imports (majority processed) also increased in 2010-11 to $10.6 billion, $0.5 billion higher than in 2009-10. Australia's net food exports (trade surplus in unprocessed and processed foods) in 2010-11 increased to $16.5 billion, $2.1 billion higher than in the previous year.</p>
<p>The value of Australia's processed food and beverage exports and imports will be discussed in detail in <em><a href="#h4_6">Section 2.2.2</a></em> - Trade.</p>
<h4 id="h4_2">2.1.2 Number of food processing businesses</h4>
<p>As at June 2011, the total number of businesses in the food and beverage processing industry was 13 015 (<strong><a href="#tbl_2-1">Table 2.1</a></strong>). Of those businesses, 12 823 (almost 99 per cent) were SMEs. Almost three-quarters of the domestic industry's revenue, however, is accounted for by Australia's 50 largest food and beverage corporations, most of them large multi-national corporations.<sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fnr_7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The bakery product manufacturing (non-factory based) industry group had the largest share of businesses (employing and non-employing) relative to other industry groups, followed by beverage manufacturing (mostly wine).</p>
<p>The industry is dominated by a relatively high proportion of SMEs. Some industry groups are dominated by small-scale businesses (such as bakeries and wineries) where most of the output is produced by a large number of small-scale producers that focus on niche markets and serving their respective localities. This is in contrast to industry groups such as meat processing, dairy product manufacturing and sugar and confectionary manufacturing which have a relatively high proportion of large firms (200+ employees) that are characterised by economies of scale.</p>
<p>Non-factory based bakeries were introduced into the ANZSIC Manufacturing Division in 2007-08 and this has had an impact on trend data for the food processing industry.</p>

<p>Source: ABS 8165.0 - <em>Counts of Australian Businesses, including Entries and Exits</em>, June 2007 to June 2011</p>
<h4 id="h4_3">2.1.3 Entries and exits</h4>
<p>The number of businesses operating in the food and beverage processing industry has been growing steadily over the period from 2008 to 2011. The major contributors to this increase have been the non-employing businesses and small businesses (1-19 employees) which have increased by 13.8 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>The number of medium-sized businesses (20-199 employees) declined during the period from 2008 to 2010 when the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) was in effect.</p>
<p>The figures following show entries and exits in selected ANZSIC groups.</p>

<p>The meat product manufacturing sector (<strong><a href="#fig_2-2">Figure 2.2</a></strong>) saw a spike in the number of entries of small businesses (1-19 employees) in 2009-10, while the number of exits has remained relatively flat over the period from 2007 to 2011. This spike in entries could be attributed to improved economic conditions in Japan, the United States and South Korea after the GFC.</p>
<p>A relatively large number of medium-sized businesses (20-199 employees) exited during the 2008-09 financial year when the GFC had the greatest impact on markets.</p>

<p>The seafood processing sector (<strong><a href="#fig_2-3">Figure 2.3</a></strong>) is one of the smallest sectors in terms of the number of businesses in operation. It has consistently seen a large number of exits for both SMEs.</p>
<p id="fig_2-4">Figure 2.4: Business Entries and Exits in Bakery Product Manufacturing</p>

<p>For the period 2007-11, almost double the number of medium-sized businesses exited the bakery product and beverage manufacturing sectors as compared to the entrants (<strong><a href="#fig_2-4">Figure 2.4</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#fig_2-5">Figure 2.5</a></strong> respectively). This trend is rather disconcerting as both these sectors are the biggest in terms of the number of businesses and employment.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that many exits recorded could be due to mergers or takeovers of successful businesses. Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data does not take into account these events.</p>

<h4 id="h4_4">2.1.4 Geographical spread</h4>
<p>The food and beverage processing Industry is an integral part of Australia's manufacturing base. A majority of the businesses are located along the east coast of Australia where a high proportion of the population resides. The remote and inland regions account for a small percentage of businesses compared to the capital and other large cities.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#fig_2-6">Figure 2.6</a></strong> displays food and beverage processing employment in terms of geographical spread. Victoria and New South Wales have relatively higher proportions of food and beverage processing employment, indicating the traditional importance of industrial and agricultural employment in these states and their relatively higher proportions of employing food and beverage processing businesses.<sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fnr_8">8</a></sup> Interestingly, the employment composition depicted by <strong><a href="#fig_2-6">Figure 2.6</a></strong> has remained virtually unchanged since 1995, which is indicative of the relative stability in the sector.</p>

<h5>Meat processing industry</h5>
<p>Meat processing is undertaken in all states and territories. The operations are highly concentrated around the eastern states lead by Queensland (45.3 per cent), New South Wales (24.2 per cent) and Victoria (14.8 per cent).</p>
<p>Queensland accounts for almost half the cattle livestock herd, approximately 11.2 million in 2010.<sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fnr_9">9</a></sup> The region is also home to the country's largest corporate beef cattle farms.</p>
<p>Abattoirs are commonly located in rural areas located close to livestock producers. This provides a number of benefits, such as lower transport costs for processors and reduced time livestock is held in transit (which reduces bruising during transport). Other factors that encourage the settlement of meat processors in rural areas include the lower cost of land and municipal by-laws.</p>
<h5>Seafood processing</h5>
<p>Queensland has the greatest share of seafood processing facilities. This is based on demand for, and supply of, prawns from northern fisheries.</p>
<p>Establishments in New South Wales and Tasmania have declined significantly since 2003-04 as many smaller operators have closed or merged with larger operators. In New South Wales increased fisheries regulation and declining fish stocks have helped drive this trend. Marine farming, however, expanded rapidly in Tasmania in the 1990s to become one of Tasmania's major industries. Other secondary industries have also grown up around Tasmania's marine farming industry, creating additional economic and employment benefits to the state.</p>
<p>The proportion of establishments in South Australia has increased significantly due to the large number of aquaculture facilities located in the state.</p>
<p>The proportions of establishments in Victoria and Western Australia have remained steady. According to IBISWorld data, the distribution of establishments is not expected to change significantly in the 2011-2012 financial year.</p>
<h5>Milk and cream processing</h5>
<p>While milk production in Australia has grown by about 41 per cent over the past decade, milk consumption has only increased by about 6.8 per cent over the same period.</p>
<p>Processing operations are heavily concentrated along the eastern states, and Victoria is expected to account for 64.2 per cent of milk production over the five years through 2011-12. New South Wales follows behind Victoria, accounting for just over 11.9 per cent of milk production, as milk production in this area is more subject to drought. This is also the case for Queensland and Western Australia. Despite this, New South Wales accounts for the highest percentage of consumption, at 31.2 per cent, followed by Victoria and Queensland with 24 per cent and 22 per cent respectively. The raw milk is either processed for drinking milk or manufactured for various dairy products. There is a big variation between the states in the proportion going into drinking milk versus dairy manufacturing.</p>
<h5>Fruit and vegetable processing</h5>
<p>Fruit and vegetable processing occurs in all Australian states; however, a relatively high proportion of businesses are situated in New South Wales (31.2 per cent) and Victoria (27.3 per cent).<sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fnr_10">10</a></sup> In Tasmania, 75 per cent of the state's vegetable production goes through processors and is a critical income source for farmers especially in the North East and West of the state.</p>
<p>The fruit and vegetable processing industry is unlike other manufacturing industries as it is not highly concentrated in capital cities. Historically, fruit and vegetable processors have been located in major horticultural centres. Country regions like the Goulburn Valley in Victoria and the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area in New South Wales support many fruit and vegetable processing businesses. Proximity to fruit and vegetable growers assists to minimise transportation costs while maintaining product freshness.</p>
<h5>Sugar manufacturing</h5>
<p>Sugar industry activity is heavily concentrated in Queensland. Since cane quality declines quickly after harvesting, sugar processors tend to locate close to sugar cane farms. Therefore, it is not surprising that the industry is heavily concentrated in Queensland, given that this state is home to about 90 per cent of the country's sugarcane farms. Queensland provides ideal climatic conditions for sugarcane production due to its subtropical weather patterns that are characterised by plentiful supplies of sunshine and a high level of annual rainfall. Queensland also has good infrastructure and reliable irrigation water supply.</p>
<p>Queensland currently has 16 raw sugar mills, mostly around Bundaberg and between Mackay and Cairns. Two refineries also operate in Mackay and Bundaberg. Mills and refineries are usually located close to bulk shipping terminals. Seven terminals operate along the Queensland coast.</p>
<h5>Wine manufacturing</h5>
<p>Wine production is closely correlated with distribution. Wine manufacturing facilities are often located near vineyards to optimise transport costs and ensure the freshest grapes are crushed. South Australia and Victoria tend to produce a higher proportion of premium wines than other states. Conversely, New South Wales produces a higher proportion of low unit value wines.</p>
<p>South Australia dominates the Australian wine manufacturing industry, accounting for 47.5 per cent of production. In South Australia, wineries are concentrated in the south-east of the state, around Coonawarra, Barossa and regions surrounding Adelaide. Reliable rainfall, warm summer conditions and good soil conditions make these areas optimal for grape vines.</p>
<p>The next most significant state for wine production is New South Wales, which accounts for approximately 28.8 per cent of Australian wine manufacturing output. A long belt of NSW wineries begins in the damp, grape-growing environment of the Hunter Valley and continues across the Great Dividing Range through Orange and Forbes, and on to Griffith in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area.</p>
<p>Victoria is another important centre for the wine manufacturing industry, accounting for 18.5 per cent of wine production. Victorian wineries are mostly located in the warm, high rainfall regions along the Murray River in Central Victoria and Western Victoria.</p>
<p>In Western Australia, the grape-growing regions south of Perth have become popular for winery development. The most famous is Margaret River, but Frankland and Mount Barker also sustain wineries.</p>
<p>Tasmania has a very small but fast-growing wine industry. The state produces cool climate wines such as Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc.</p>
<h3 id="h3_12">2.2 Economic Contribution</h3>
<h4 id="h4_5">2.2.1 Industry value added</h4>
<p>In 2010-11, the manufacturing industry's gross value added (GVA) was approximately $107.6 billion. Of this, the food, beverage and tobacco<sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fnr_11">11</a></sup> processing sector accounted for approximately 21.9 per cent ($23.6 billion), and as <strong><a href="#fig_2-7">Figure 2.7</a></strong> illustrates, it was the largest contributor to total manufacturing GVA.</p>
<p id="fig_2-7">Figure 2.7: Gross Value Added Share by Manufacturing Subdivision, 2010-11</p>
<p><img src="./images/fig_011.jpg" alt="An illustration of pie chart depicting the sectors of Gross Value Added Manufacturing subdivision, 2010-11." /></p>
<p>Source: ABS, <em>Australian National Accounts: National Income, Expenditure and Product Sep 2011</em> (Cat No 5206.0) Table 33. Gross Value Added by Industry, Chain volume measures, annual.<br /><a href="#des_7">Text description for Gross Value Added Share by Manufacturing Subdivision, 2010-11</a></p>
<p>From 2000-01 to 2010-11, food and beverage GVA grew <em>on average</em> by 0.4 per cent per annum, which was slightly below the overall manufacturing annual growth rate of 0.7 per cent. The overall (economy-wide) average annual growth rate from 2000 to 2010, however, was substantially higher at 3.1 per cent.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#fig_2-8">Figure 2.8</a></strong> shows a significant divergence between the overall economy, the manufacturing and the food and beverage processing sectors. From 2000 to 2011,<sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fnr_12">12</a></sup> overall GVA grew 37.6 per cent, while food and beverage and total manufacturing GVA grew by 8.4 and 10.5 per cent respectively. As a result of this divergence, food and beverage GVA as a share of total GDP has decreased from 2.3 per cent in 2000 to 1.9 per cent in 2011.</p>
<p id="fig_2-8">Figure 2.8: Growth in Gross Value Added by Category</p>
<p><img src="./images/fig_012.jpg" alt="An illustration of  line graph with years on horizontal axis and ranges on vertical axis. The three lines depicting the movements of manufacturing, food, beverage, tobacco products, and total Gross Value." /></p>
<p>Source: ABS 5206.0 - <em>Australian National Accounts: National Income, Expenditure and Product</em>, Industry Gross Value Added, Chain Volume Measures (N.B The tobacco sector employs less than 2000 employees and there were only three tobacco product businesses - two manufacturers - in Australia as at June 2011)<br /><a href="#des_8">Text description for Growth in Gross Value Added by Category</a></p>
<p>This same trend can be seen in other advanced economies, such as those illustrated in <strong><a href="#fig_2-9">Figure 2.9</a></strong>. While more data is needed to establish the pervasiveness of this trend among developed countries, this initial snapshot does seem to confirm a trend. As <strong><a href="#fig_2-9">Figure 2.9</a></strong> suggests, over time as an economy develops, the food and beverage processing sector does seem to play a diminishing role in the economy. From 1980 to 2009, the Japanese food and processing sector went from over 3.0 per cent of the economy to around 2.5 per cent, while in Australia it went from 3.0 per cent to 1.8 per cent. The United States (US) has also seen a similar decline, with the food and beverage processing sector decreasing from over 2.0 per cent to just below 1.5 per cent. Of these countries, however, South Korea has by far seen the most dramatic shift with food and beverage processing decreasing from 3.5 per cent to just over 1.0 per cent of GDP.</p>
<p id="fig_2-9">Figure 2.9: Food, Beverage and Tobacco Gross Value Added and Gross Domestic Product</p>
<p><img src="./images/fig_013.jpg" alt="An illustration of line graph with years on horizontal axis and percentage on vertical axis. The five lines depicting the countries and average of Gross Value Added and Gross Domestic Product." /></p>
<p>Source: Ecowin, Reuters<br /><a href="#des_9">Text description for Food, Beverage and Tobacco Gross Value Added and Gross Domestic Product</a></p>
<p>This trend among developed countries may be largely explained by economic consumer theory; in particular, that of inferior and normal goods.<sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fnr_13">13</a></sup> As countries continue to grow and develop, and income per capita increases, the proportion of total income spent on inferior goods, such as food and beverage products, becomes smaller. Consumers begin to spend their increasing incomes on luxury items and services (e.g. dining at restaurants), while the expenditures on inferior goods holds constant or even declines. Therefore, in industries such as the food and beverage product manufacturing industry, absolute growth will depend on population growth, while relative growth (proportion of GDP) will rely on opportunities outside of the domestic market, such as increasing exports into other markets.</p>
<h5>Industry value added by selected industry groups</h5>
<p>Meat processing (excluding poultry, bacon and ham processing - $2 126 million); cheese and other dairy product manufacturing (excluding milk and cream processing - $1 804 million); and soft drink, cordial and syrup manufacturing ($1 791 million) were the largest industry groups in 2009-10 in terms of industry value added (<strong><a href="#fig_2-10">Figure 2.10</a></strong>). Oil and fat manufacturing, and ice-cream manufacturing were the smallest industry groups in terms of industry value added ($174 million and $170 million respectively).</p>

<h4 id="h4_6">2.2.2 Trade</h4>
<h5>The global food industry</h5>
<p>In 2010, the value of global food exports was estimated at US$1026 billion of which the world's largest food exporter, the United States, had a market share of 10.8 per cent. The global food industry has seen rapidly increasing international food prices over the last decade which is underpinned by rising global demand.</p>
<p>Australia ranked 16th in the world as a food exporter in 2010 and 32nd as a food importer (<strong><a href="#tbl_2-2">Table 2.2</a></strong>). Australia is a significant exporter for food products such as wheat, sugar, barley, beef and sheep meat, live sheep and cattle, and wine. Interestingly, many of the other big food exporters are also significant importers of food.</p>
<p>Australia's geographic location gives it access to the largest growth market, Asia, which has seen considerable expansion, especially China, whose value of food imports increased by 32 per cent in 2010.</p>
<p>For processed foods, alcoholic beverages were the most globally traded food and beverage product in value terms in 2010, followed by meat (<strong><a href="#fig_2-11">Figure 2.11</a></strong>).</p>

<h5>Largest markets</h5>
<p>The United States is the world's largest food exporter and importer with market shares of 10.8 per cent and 9.3 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>It has a large and diverse population which demands healthy, high-quality food in addition to catering for new ethnic group migrants adding to its already significant multicultural mix. Of particular note has been an increasing demand in the speciality food segment. Gourmet food which was previously considered the food of the elite is now being chosen by the mainstream population.</p>
<h5>Growth markets</h5>
<p>For rapidly developing countries in Asia, the proportion of incomes being spent on processed foods relative to unprocessed foods (agricultural products) is only a small fraction of that seen in developed countries. As these countries develop and incomes grow, consumers in these markets are likely to spend an increasing proportion on processed foods. This suggests that markets for processed foods will expand quickly in the years to come, and this represents an opportunity for Australia as it has a comparative advantage in processed foods such as meat and dairy. This opportunity for Australian food manufacturing companies may diminish as these countries begin to increase the quality, reliability and safety of their food industry outputs and as more multinationals locate and establish their factories in Asia.</p>
<h6>China</h6>
<p>In 2010-11, Australian processed and unprocessed food exports to China were valued at approximately $1.5 billion,<sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fnr_14">14</a></sup> up 6 per cent from 2009-10. This increased interest and demand for Australian food is driven by China's increasing per capita income. As living standards have improved, so too has the Chinese consumers' desire for more variety and higher quality foods, and increasing demand for protein such as meat and dairy.</p>
<p>There is a window of opportunity here for Australian food manufacturing companies which may diminish as China begins to increase the quality, reliability and safety of its food industry outputs and as more multinationals locate and establish their factories in China.</p>
<p>However, China is also currently a significant exporter of food as well as of consumer goods, and like other industrialised countries is facing many challenges to maintain its level of outputs, including the availability of resources, and energy and water use. It is therefore a moot point as to how long China can continue to expand its food exports while domestic demand increases.</p>
<p>Foreign supermarket chain retailers (such as Wal-mart, Trust-Mart, Makro, Jusco, Carrefour, Tesco, Lotus, Metro, Park'N Shop, 7-Eleven and Watson's), and major domestic chain store outlets (such as Hualian, Lianhua, and Vanguard) have rapidly expanded in China. These supermarkets have become more diversified and sophisticated, and offer consumers an increased range of imported foods and beverages, as international food brands are gaining popularity with Chinese consumers.<sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fnr_15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Growth in the number of food retail outlets and chains also present an opportunity for Australian exporters of food to China. All of the foreign-funded supermarkets plan to increase their investment in China.</p>
<p>Australia is recognised by Chinese consumers as having a 'clean and green' environment with good quality products and brands. Many Australian exporters have already taken advantage of this competitive edge by establishing a position as a supplier of products such as meat, dairy products, fresh fruits and seafood. Access to China by SMEs will be difficult unless they operate under a trusted brand, and identifying distribution channels will be critical.</p>
<p>Market feedback has shown interest in Australian suppliers of: milk powder; Ultra High Temperature treated (UHT) milk; cheese; butter and margarine; seafood (oysters, live lobster, live abalone, live king crab); fresh fruit (citrus); wheat, barley and rice; frozen red meats (beef, veal, lamb); processed foods, particularly baby food; wine and beer; fruit juice; convenience and 'instant' foods; and confectionery and snack products.</p>
<p>Australian wine exports to China in 2010-11 were valued at $178 million, up 23.6 per cent from the previous year. China has grown to be Australia's fourth-largest market in terms of value of wine exports.<sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fnr_16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Following entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), China reduced its overall average tariff for agricultural products from 21.2 per cent to 15.3 per cent. However, it still has pockets of high tariff protection - as high as 65 per cent on some key products of interest to Australia, such as wheat. Nonetheless, the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations are progressing on tariffs and other market access issues. These include tariff rate quotas, standards and technical regulations.<sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fnr_17">17</a></sup></p>
<h6>Republic of Korea</h6>
<p>South Korea is the third-largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region, behind Japan and China. Its population of 49 million is highly urbanised with nearly a quarter of the population living in Seoul. It imports a considerable proportion of its food requirements, around 60 to 70 per cent. Food safety is of critical importance to consumers and the South Korean Government is tightening regulatory systems in response to various food incidents and labelling issues.</p>
<p>Overall, the South Korean market for food and beverages is vibrant, rapidly adapting to new trends and focussed on cost and value. Most products need to be customised for taste and packaging and a good partner in the market is essential to business success. Australia is seen as a supplier of safe and high-quality food, and the South Korean Government is keen to learn from our regulatory systems. Customers will purchase Australian products if competitively priced and suppliers are flexible and responsive.</p>
<p>South Korea has relatively high tariff rates and quota restrictions covering a broad range of imported food products. South Korea, however, is also proactive in developing bilateral FTAs with trading partners and this represents an opportunity for Australia. Australia's future competitiveness in the Korean market will depend to a large extent on the successful completion of an Australia-Korea FTA.</p>
<h6>Indonesia</h6>
<p>During 2009, Indonesia was the third-fastest growing economy in the G20. Increasing per capita income over the past decade has led to a thriving middle and upper-class market which accounts for 30 million consumers. There is a growing preference in this segment of the market for imported goods, particularly meat, dairy and convenience snacks. Being a predominantly Muslim country, Islamic dietary conditions are observed, so products that satisfy halal requirements sell best.</p>
<p>Principal Australian exports to Indonesia include live cattle, dairy, fresh produce, meat (excluding beef), lamb, cereal, beverages and wine.</p>
<p>The United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are Indonesia's top sources of food imports, although China's share is increasing as it becomes a key source for fresh fruit and vegetables and other food products.</p>
<p>The retailing infrastructure continues to improve with developments of new shopping precincts and expansion of retail chains, especially in the major cities. Australian products face a receptive audience with established ties held by Indonesians having travelled, studied or lived in Australia.</p>
<h6>Malaysia</h6>
<p>Malaysia is one of South East Asia's more developed nations. The Malaysian food sector is expanding after strong economic growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Growth in this sector, a middle- to high-income market, coupled with a sizable expatriate population and tourist market, indicates that there are good growth prospect opportunities.</p>
<p>Malaysia's food and beverage sector consists of a mix of traditional markets, restaurants, street vendors, sophisticated modern retailing (supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores) and food service operations (hotels, restaurants and institutions).</p>
<p>On 22 May 2012, the Australia-Malaysia FTA negotiations concluded with the signing of the final Australia-Malaysia FTA. The agreement will allow annual increases in Australian exports of liquid milk at zero tariff; the immediate elimination of tariffs on processed foods and the phase out of tariffs on tropical fruit (mangoes, melons, pineapples and longans) by 2016. The agreement also includes business-friendly rules of origin provisions, including a simpler declaration of origin instead of certificate of origin requirements for exporters. The agreement is expected to enter into force in 2013.</p>
<h6>Thailand</h6>
<p>Within Thailand's population of 63 million, a growing and increasingly affluent middle class has emerged and increased the demand for imported foods. In conjunction with that, Thailand has a large expatriate population and is a popular tourist destination. These players demand a range of Western-style products and high-value goods, of which a significant proportion is imported.</p>
<p>Supermarkets and hypermarkets have grown dramatically in number and turnover in the last six years and provide significant opportunities for exporters. Imported meat, fruit, wine, dairy products and grocery items are now mainstream products in many Thai food retail outlets. The convenience sector is also growing strongly and increasing its offering of imported products.</p>
<p>There has been growing concern among Thai consumers about food security, and that food needs to meet international safety and quality requirements. These fears stem from food scares related to bird flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (commonly known as 'mad-cow' disease) in the United States, and, most recently, contamination of milk products from China. Hence the increased demand for products which meet the safety and quality requirements presents significant opportunities for Australian food exporters.</p>
<p>A fundamental change in the trading relationship between Australia and Thailand took place when the Thailand-Australia FTA was signed in 2005. This agreement liberalised trade in many sectors including food and has led to a range of new opportunities. Each year tariffs are reduced on a range of food products giving Australia a significant competitive advantage over its major competitors. For example, under the Australia-Thailand FTA, the tariff on table grape exports to Thailand was immediately reduced from 33 per cent to 30 per cent, and will be phased to zero by 2015. Between 2003-04 and 2008-09 there has been a fourfold increase in table grape exports, which are now valued at over $24 million. Australian beef exports to Thailand have also benefitted. The tariff on beef was reduced from 51 per cent to 40 per cent on commencement, and will be reduced to zero by 2020. The value of beef exports to Thailand has more than doubled between 2003-04 and 2008-09.<sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fnr_18">18</a></sup></p>
<h6>The Philippines</h6>
<p>The Philippines is one of the world's fastest growing economies and has one of the youngest populations, with approximately 65 per cent of its 101 million residents under the age of 30. A rapidly expanding food service sector driven by foreign investment will provide considerable opportunities for Australian food exporters. A lack of employment opportunities and low income has led to an increasing number of Filipinos working overseas who send money back to their families, thus boosting their purchasing power. The middle and upper-class consumers are based in the national capital region, Manila and major urban centres including Cebu and Davao. Supermarkets, hypermarkets and convenience stores are expanding in the urban centres.</p>
<p>While the general macroeconomic outlook has improved dramatically over recent years, the Philippines needs to continue its economic reform agenda to ensure its long-term fiscal stability and to catch up to other South East Asian economies. The Philippines has a volatile political history; however, since 2001 the country has been relatively stable. The Philippines still has issues with rapid population growth, natural disasters and crime which are hampering growth.</p>
<p>Recent economic liberalisation has resulted in a trading system that is more transparent and has some of the lowest applied tariffs in the region. Tariff rates (currently undergoing unilateral reduction) for most consumer-oriented products range from 3 per cent to 15 per cent, except for industries considered sensitive such as poultry, pork, potatoes and coffee, which have minimum access volumes and significantly higher tariff rates. The Philippines is a member of the WTO and ASEAN and as such is an important member of the Australian-NZ-ASEAN FTA.</p>
<h5>Australian food trade</h5>
<p>Australian total food exports (fresh and packaged) were valued at approximately $27.1 billion in 2010-11. Over the past eight years food exports have remained relatively constant, barring a sharp rise in value of approximately $28 billion in 2008-09 due partly to the high world grain prices and the low Australian dollar at that time, the latter which helped drive demand.</p>
<p>Grains and meat have consistently been the two largest sectors in the Australian food industry and accounted for approximately 54 per cent of the value of Australian food exports in 2010-11.</p>
<p>Japan remained the leading destination for Australian food exports in 2009-10 (see <strong><a href="#fig_2-12">Figure 2.12</a></strong>). Other major export destinations for Australian food are USA, New Zealand, Hong Kong and UK.</p>

<p>While Asia presents many opportunities for Australian exporters of processed foods, it is not homogeneous, and exporters need to be familiar with the varying import requirements and food regulation in the various markets. Trade barriers can make exporting difficult where free trade agreements do not exist. Currently there appears to be a lack of transparency for industry regarding import requirements for Asian markets, especially food regulation. There is also a lack of clarity on the level of domestic subsidies active in potential export markets, the latter an important consideration for Australian food manufacturers seeking to export for the first time. The Australian Customs Service is attempting to address this issue by publishing a Subsidies Register; however, information on subsidies is limited to those goods for which Customs has undertaken anti-dumping investigations. Currently, the Register only features one item of interest in this context, brandy.<sup><a href="#fn_19" id="fnr_19">19</a></sup></p>
<h5>Australian trade in processed food and beverage products</h5>
<p>In 2010-11, the food and beverage processing industry was the second-largest manufacturing exporter (<strong><a href="#fig_2-13">Figure 2.13</a></strong>), accounting for approximately 20.2 per cent of total manufacturing exports. From 2005-06 to 2010-11, food product exports grew on average by 1.6 per cent per annum, while beverage and tobacco product exports declined on average by 4.8 per cent per annum.</p>

<p>As a percentage of total merchandise/goods exports, the food and beverage processing sector accounted for 6.9 per cent. However, as shown in <strong><a href="#fig_2-14">Figure 2.14</a></strong>, food and beverage product exports as a proportion of both total merchandise/goods exports and manufacturing exports have been gradually declining since 2005.</p>

  <a href="#des_14">Text description for Food and Beverage Exports as a Proportion of Total Manufacturing Exports and Total Merchandise/Goods Exports</a></p>
<p>During 2010-11, the food and beverage processing industry exported $16.97 billion worth of goods, while food and beverage processing imports were $10.43 billion. This represented net exports of $6.54 billion worth of food and beverage products in 2010-11, and represents an export ratio (exports/imports) of 162.7 per cent, which is significantly higher than that of the total merchandise export ratio (114.8 per cent).</p>
<p><strong><a href="#fig_2-15">Figure 2.15</a></strong> illustrates that Australia continues to be a significant net exporter of processed food and beverage products. However, <strong><a href="#fig_2-15">Figure 2.15</a></strong> also illustrates that imports of processed food and beverage products have been increasing since 2005, while exports have remained relatively flat since 2005.</p>
<p>From 2005-06 to 2010-11, food product imports grew by 8.2 per cent per annum, while beverage and tobacco imports grew by 8.4 per cent per annum. This is in contrast to exports, where food product exports grew on average by 1.6 per cent per annum, while beverage and tobacco product exports declined on average by 4.8 per cent per annum over the same period.</p>

<p>One key factor that has accounted for much of the increase in processed food and beverage product imports is the appreciation of the Australian dollar (<strong><a href="#fig_2-16">Figure 2.16</a></strong>).</p>
<p id="fig_2-16">Figure 2.16: Australian Exchange Rate</p>
<p><img src="./images/fig_020.jpg" alt="An illustration of graph with month and year on horizontal axis, Trade weighted Index and US$ on vertical axis. Two slotted curve depicting the Australian exchange Rate." /></p>
<p>Source: ABS, 5368.0 - <em>International Trade in Goods and Services, Australia</em>, April 2012<br /><a href="#des_16">Text description for Australian Exchange Rate</a></p>
<p>The Australian dollar has appreciated by 39 per cent since July 2005 against the US dollar and by 11 per cent against the currencies of Australia's main trading partners (measured by the trade-weighted index).</p>
<p>One advantage of a stronger Australian currency is that it reduces the relative cost of imported inputs to food processing, including fuel and capital equipment. However, for many food and beverage processors, these cost savings are likely to only partially offset the impact of the high exchange rate. The strong Australian dollar has adversely affected some export and import-competing food and beverage processing sectors, as they are facing increasing competition from cheaper imports due to the high Australian dollar, and has also lead to lower export earnings as most export contracts are denominated in US dollars.</p>
<h5>Australian food exports and imports, by industry groups</h5>
<p>A detailed overview of Australia's food exports and imports by industry group over the period 1995-96 to 2010-11 is provided in <strong><a href="#fig_2-17">Figure 2.17</a></strong>. The grains, meat, wine, beer, malt and spirits, and dairy industries have been the major contributors to the overall growth in Australia's food export earnings since the mid-1990s. In contrast, export earnings from processed seafood, processed fruit and vegetables, sugar and fresh/chilled vegetables have declined.</p>
<p>Major contributors to the growth in imports have been processed fruit and vegetables, processed food not elsewhere classified, bakery products, confectionary, beer and malt, and wine.</p>

<p>CASE STUDY</p>
<p>Harvey Fresh, a leading Western Australian dairy, fruit juice and wine manufacturer, has acquired juice processor Nugan Quality Foods. There is currently a booming export market for Australian fruit and vegetable juices in South East Asia, and Harvey Fresh is hoping to pull ahead of competition from New Zealand and South America with the acquisition of Nugan which already exports to the Asian market. Nugan has been exporting juice products to Asia since the late 1980s and has developed positive relationships with customers and suppliers.</p>

<h5>Food and beverage product exports by level of transformation</h5>
<p>Processed food and beverage exports are divided into two categories:<sup><a href="#fn_20" id="fnr_20">20</a></sup> substantially transformed goods (STG) and elaborately transformed goods (ETG). STG are goods such as meat, some dairy products (such as milk powder) and sugar. ETG goods are goods such as biscuits and confectionary. As one might expect, ETG are more intensive in intellectual property, capital, and innovation. During 2009-10, ETG exports accounted for 2.1 per cent of total processed food and beverage exports, which was up slightly from the previous financial year, when it was 1.9 per cent. As shown below in <strong><a href="#fig_2-18">Figure 2.18</a></strong>, the composition of exports, in terms of transformation, has changed little since 2002-03. STG exports, as a proportion of total processed food and beverage exports, have hovered around 97-98 per cent.</p>
<p id="fig_2-18">Figure 2.18: Food and Beverage Exports by Level of Transformation</p>
<p><img src="./images/fig_024.jpg" alt="An illustration of bar diagram with years on horizontal axis and ranges on vertical axis. Two bars for each year are representing the substantially and elaborately level of transformation." /></p>
<p>Source: Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2011, <em>Australian Food Statistics: 2009-10</em>.<br /><a href="#des_18">Text description for Food and Beverage Exports by Level of Transformation</a></p>
<p>The composition of imports by level of transformation is similar to exports, with the majority of food and beverage imports being made up of STG. During 2009-10, ETG imports accounted for 4.6 per cent of total food and beverage imports, with the remaining 95.4 per cent comprised of STG. From 2002-03 to 2009-10, ETG imports have increased slightly from 3.6 per cent of total food and beverage imports.</p>
<p>In absolute terms, imports of both ETG and STG have grown at a faster rate than exports. From 2002-03 to 2009-10, exports of ETG and STG grew at an average annual rate of 1.2 and 0.2 per cent respectively. Imports of ETG and STG, however, grew at an annual rate of 7.9 and 11.7 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>The divergence in growth rates of exports versus imports has, as <strong><a href="#fig_2-19">Figure 2.19</a></strong> shows, led to a decline in the net export figures for both ETG and STG. This decline has been particularly acute for ETG, which went from a net export of $161 in 2002-03 to a net import of $73 million in 2009-10. Over the same period, net STG exports decreased by a quarter from $10 billion to $7.5 billion.</p>

<h4 id="h4_7">2.2.3 Employment</h4>
<p>Employment in the food and beverage processing industry is relatively stable and variability in this sector is mostly attributed to changes in numbers of causal and seasonal workers. The level of casual and seasonal workers is often dependent on the sub-sector.</p>
<p>As of May 2012, approximately 222 869 persons were employed in the food and beverage processing sector, making it the single largest employer within the manufacturing industry, accounting for nearly a quarter of total manufacturing employment. This figure is significantly higher than it was in November 2003, when the food and beverage sector accounted for 18.8 per cent of total manufacturing employment. <strong><a href="#fig_2-20">Figure 2.20</a></strong> displays employment shares by manufacturing sub-division as at May 2012.</p>
<p id="fig_2-20">Figure 2.20: Manufacturing Employment by Subdivision, May 2012</p>

<p>Employment within the food and beverage sector, as can be seen in <strong><a href="#fig_2-21">Figure 2.21</a></strong>, is dominated by bakery product and meat and meat product manufacturing, with these two groups making up over 50 per cent of total food and beverage employment. It should be noted, however, that 43 per cent of bakery product employment is comprised of non-factory-based workers and bakers who are perhaps more closely aligned to the retail sector than the food and beverage processing sector.</p>
<p>The composition of food and beverage processing employment has changed little from 1995 to 2010. Aside from this, only marginal variations have occurred in the more minor sub-groups of food and beverage processing, which do tend to vary from year to year. Grain milling and fruit and vegetable processing have declined as a proportion of total food and beverage employment.</p>

<p>When compared to the rest of the manufacturing sector, the food and beverage processing sector recorded relatively strong employment growth throughout most of the 2000s. <strong><a href="#fig_2-22">Figure 2.22</a></strong> compares food and beverage processing employment to the rest of the manufacturing sector and shows a clear divergence in employment growth from 2003 onwards. Prior to 2003, food and beverage processing employment growth largely mirrored the rest of the manufacturing sector. From 1995 to 2003 the food and beverage processing average annual employment growth rate was -0.4 per cent, while from 2003 to 2008 (just prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)), this growth rate accelerated to 3.9 per cent. The corresponding figures for the overall manufacturing sector, excluding food and beverage processing employment, were -0.3 per cent from 1995 to 2003 and -0.6 per cent from 2003 to 2008.</p>
<p>The impact of the GFC clearly had a profound effect on the manufacturing sector, and the food and beverage processing sector received some shocks. From 2008 to 2009 food and beverage processing employment decreased by 5.3 per cent (12 400 persons), while the manufacturing industry (excluding food and beverages) declined by 3.9 per cent (32 100 persons). Unlike the rest of the manufacturing industry, however, the food and beverage processing sector experienced a significant recovery. From 2009 to 2010, food and beverage processing employment grew 2.6 per cent, while non-food and beverage processing continued to decline, recording a drop in employment of 2.8 per cent. It is worth noting that employment growth from 2009 to 2010 in the food and beverage processing sector was only slightly below that of the economy as a whole, which grew by 2.7 per cent.<sup><a href="#fn_21" id="fnr_21">21</a></sup></p>

<p>Source: ABS, 6291.0.55.003 - <em>Labour Force, Australia</em>, Detailed, Quarterly, Feb 2011<br /><a href="#des_22">Text description for Employment by Sector</a></p>
<p>As shown in the left-hand side of <strong><a href="#fig_2-23">Figure 2.23</a></strong>, when compared to overall employment growth from 1995 to 2010, both food and beverage processing and total manufacturing (excluding food and beverage processing) employment were significantly lower. However, as shown in the right-hand side of <strong><a href="#fig_2-23">Figure 2.23</a></strong>, which re-bases the employment index to 2003, food and beverage processing employment was actually quite similar to overall employment growth. Furthermore, had the effects of the GFC not been so concentrated on the food and beverage processing and manufacturing sectors, food and beverage processing employment would likely have been higher.<sup><a href="#fn_22" id="fnr_22">22</a></sup></p>

<h5>Full-time and part-time employment</h5>
<p>Of the 222 869 food and beverage processing employees (as at May 2012), 23.8 per cent are classified as part-time,<sup><a href="#fn_23" id="fnr_23">23</a></sup> which is at a higher rate than the rest of the manufacturing sector (10.4 per cent), but less than the overall part-time employment rate of 30.0 per cent.</p>
<p>As shown in <strong><a href="#fig_2-24">Figure 2.24</a></strong>, the part-time employment rate<sup><a href="#fn_24" id="fnr_24">24</a></sup> in the food and beverage processing sector has been gradually increasing, rising from around 17 per cent in 1995 to nearly 23 per cent in 2010. As <strong><a href="#fig_2-24">Figure 2.24</a></strong> suggests, the higher part-time rate can be attributed to relatively high growth in part-time employment, while full-time employment growth has been relatively poor. From 1995 to 2010, part-time employment increased 47.5 per cent, while full-time employment increased only 7.5 per cent.</p>
<p id="fig_2-24">Figure 2.24: Full-time/Part-time Employment in the Food Processing Sector</p>
<p><img src="./images/fig_030.jpg" alt="An illustration of line graph with years on horizontal axis and percentage on vertical axis. Three slotted curves depicting the full-time, part-time, and part-time rate employment in the food processing sector." /></p>
<p>Source: ABS, 6291.0.55.003 - <em>Labour Force, Australia</em>, Detailed, Quarterly, Feb 2011<br /><a href="#des_24">Text description for Full-time/Part-time Employment in the Food Processing Sector</a></p>
<p>There are a number of possible explanations behind the upward trend in part-time employment, comprising both demand and supply drivers. On the demand side, institutional reforms and labour market liberalisation have made it easier for firms to create part-time jobs. Such reforms include provisions for part-time and casual employment in awards (which did not previously exist), and the removal of certain restrictions on part-time work.<sup><a href="#fn_25" id="fnr_25">25</a></sup> Also on the demand side is the significant restructuring of manufacturing business models and supply chains in the wake of globalisation<sup><a href="#fn_26" id="fnr_26">26</a></sup> and microeconomic reform. As companies have faced increasing pressures to become more flexible, firms may have increased part-time employment to more efficiently spread their production costs over cyclical fluctuations. The seasonal nature of some food processing sectors may also be impacting on the increase in part-time workers, e.g. an attempt to even out the fluctuations of seasonal employment peaks and troughs.</p>
<p>On the supply side, a number of demographic shifts such as the ageing workforce and increased female participation rates have been partially responsible for the overall upward trend in part-time employment. From 1995-96 to 2009-2010, manufacturing workers aged 15-24 have declined in absolute numbers by 26 per cent, while those aged 25-54 have declined by 3 per cent. The share of manufacturing workers aged 55 years and over, however, increased by 75 per cent.<sup><a href="#fn_27" id="fnr_27">27</a></sup> Also, given the preference for part-time work by mature workers,<sup><a href="#fn_28" id="fnr_28">28</a></sup> it was inevitable the overall part-time rate would increase as their share of the workforce increased.</p>
<h4 id="h4_8">2.2.4 Labour productivity</h4>
<p>In terms of labour productivity, the food and beverage processing industry had, until 2004, performed relatively well. Food and beverage processing GVA per worker<sup><a href="#fn_29" id="fnr_29">29</a></sup> growth from 1985 to 2003, as shown below in <strong><a href="#fig_2-25">Figure 2.25</a></strong>, had tracked fairly close to that in both the total manufacturing sector as well as the overall economy. In fact, from 1996 to 2003 food and beverage processing GVA per worker grew at 2.8 per cent per annum, which was significantly higher than in both the manufacturing sector and the overall economy (both grew at 2.2 per cent per annum). From 2003 to 2010, however, GVA per worker in the food and beverage processing industry has been on the decline, falling on average by 1.3 per cent each year. Over this same period the manufacturing sector and the overall economy have grown by 1.4 and 0.8 per cent respectively. The cause of this divergence is somewhat explained by the increase in number of casuals, and when the GVA is expressed against per hour worked the trend is negative.</p>

<p>As with <strong><a href="#fig_2-25">Figure 2.25</a></strong>, <strong><a href="#fig_2-26">Figure 2.26</a></strong>, which shows GVA per hour worked, also demonstrates a relative decline in food and beverage processing productivity. From 2003 to 2010, GVA per hour decreased from $803.60 to $738.10 (8.2 per cent). Over this same period, manufacturing and overall GVA per hour increased by 7.7 and 5.9 per cent respectively. Interestingly, productivity growth prior to 2003 was substantially higher than both manufacturing and overall productivity growth.</p>

<p>As seen in <strong><a href="#fig_2-27">Figure 2.27</a></strong>, food and beverage processing GVA per hour grew by 3.7 per cent, while manufacturing and overall productivity grew by 2.8 and 2.5 per cent, respectively. Furthermore, since 2008, productivity growth in the food and beverage processing sector has grown comparatively faster. From 2008 to 2010, food and beverage processing productivity grew on average by 3.9 per cent, compared to just 1.1 per cent in total manufacturing and 0.8 per cent in the overall economy.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#fig_2-28">Figure 2.28</a></strong> shows that the greatest value added per employee in 2008-09 occurred in beer and malt manufacturing ($481 000 per employee in 2010-11), while the lowest was in bakery products ($57 000 per employee). This disparity partly reflects the capital-intensive nature of the beer and malt processing industry, and the relatively more small-scale and labour-intensive nature of bakery production.</p>
<h4 id="h4_9">2.2.5 Domestic investment</h4>
<p>Total domestic investment in new capital (that is, tangible assets including equipment, plant and machinery, and building and structures) by private enterprise in the food product manufacturing sector has been decreasing slightly since 1998 (<strong><a href="#fig_2-29">Figure 2.29</a></strong>), but for the past few years has begun to trend upwards. Total investment in new capital in the beverage product manufacturing sector has also been decreasing steadily since 1994.</p>

<p>To save on operating costs and ensure longer term sustainability, the food and beverage processing sector is investing in more energy efficient machinery and equipment. The Australian Government is seeking to support these processors by introducing the Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program. This is a $200-million, competitive, merit-based grants program to support Australian food and foundry manufacturers to maintain competitiveness in a carbon constrained economy. The program will provide grants for investments in energy efficient capital equipment and low-pollution technologies, processes and products.</p>
<h4 id="h4_10">2.2.6 Foreign investment</h4>
<p>In the past decade, corporate investors, both Australian and foreign (plus some sovereign wealth funds), have shown growing interest in large-scale agribusiness and agrifood investment in Australia.</p>
<p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) offers clear benefits to Australia. Economic consultancy Access Economics reported in October 2009 that FDI contributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>37 per cent of R&amp;D</li>
<li>50 per cent of exported goods</li>
<li>46 per cent of value of services exported</li>
<li>14 per cent of employment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Foreign investment, both direct (FDI) and indirect (portfolio), has always played a significant part in Australia's agriculture and food sector, from agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilisers and machinery, through to agricultural production, food and beverage processing, distribution, food service and food retailing, and domestic and international trading.</p>
<p>More broadly, foreign investment plays a key role in supplementing domestic savings and by facilitating development and maintenance of new internationally competitive industries and businesses. Foreign investment has similarly facilitated modernisation of substantive sectors of the economy, and in turn, driven efficiencies to enhance Australia's competitiveness.</p>
<p>European and North American investors have long had a strong presence in Australia and have been significant players in the country's domestic food and beverage industry. For example, Schweppes opened its first factory here in 1877; followed by Nestl&eacute; in 1911; Cadbury, Kraft and Kellogg in the 1920s; and Heinz in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Investment by leading European and North American agribusiness companies, like Clyde Agriculture and Cargill, as well as the multinational food and beverage processors, helped grow the Australian agriculture and food sector, and helped link Australia to world markets.</p>
<p>Despite the important role foreign investment plays in Australia's agriculture and food sectors, community concerns over a lack of transparency over foreign ownership of Australia's agricultural land and agricultural food production and the implication for Australia's domestic food security remains. On 23 November 2010, the Australian Government announced an information-gathering process to address some of these community concerns, which included a study commissioned to consider the role and history of foreign investment in the development of agriculture in Australia and the extent of foreign ownership of Australian agricultural land. This initiative also included the collection of data by the ABS on foreign investment in Australian agriculture, as information on this was limited. The ABS subsequently conducted a survey and the results show that as at 31 December 2010:<sup><a href="#fn_30" id="fnr_30">30</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>89 per cent of agricultural land was entirely Australian owned and a further 5.5 per cent at least 50 per cent Australian owned</li>
<li>99 per cent of agricultural businesses, by number, in Australia were entirely Australian owned</li>
<li>91 per cent of water entitlements for agricultural purposes were entirely Australian owned</li>
</ul>
<p>The survey results are broadly comparable with levels of foreign ownership of agricultural businesses and land collected in the Agricultural Census of 1983-84.</p>
<p>Regulation of foreign investment in Australian agriculture is greater than many OECD countries, with Australia ranked tenth-most restrictive of all OECD countries. The Government has well-established arrangements under which foreign investments are examined and applies a rigorous national interest test to all significant foreign investment applications.</p>
<p>Foreign investment assists in maximising food production and supporting Australia's position as a major net exporter of agricultural produce, by financing investment, and delivering productivity gains and technological innovations. Foreign investment in agriculture supports agricultural production, job creation and contributes to the prosperity of rural communities and the broader Australian economy. Any reduction in investment in the agricultural sector as a result of a reduction in capital inflows would be likely to result in lower food production with potentially higher food prices, lower employment, lower incomes in the sector and lower government revenue.</p>
<h4 id="h4_11">2.2.7 Strongest sub-sectors</h4>
<p><strong><a href="#tbl_2-4">Table 2.4</a></strong> provides an outline of the comparison of relative performance of the food and beverage processing sub-sectors measured in terms of industry value added; industry revenue and revenue growth; net profits as a percentage of industry revenue; employment and exports. Shaded cells show the top eight values in each measurement. This is a point-in-time representation of the industry and does not show historical trends nor predicted future performance. Nonetheless, sub-sectors where the food and beverage processing industry currently enjoys competitive advantage provide an obvious starting point for future prioritisation.</p>

<h3 id="h3_13">2.3 Outlook: challenges and opportunities</h3>
<h4 id="h4_12">2.3.1 Employment forecasts</h4>
<p>Forecasts made by the Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS) suggest that employment in the food and beverage industry will decline by an average of 0.4 per cent per year to 2017-18. As shown in <strong><a href="#fig_2-30">Figure 2.30</a></strong>, however, this rate is less than the forecasted decline in the overall manufacturing sector (-1.4 per cent), which will result in an increase in the proportion of food and beverage processing workers. According to these estimates, food and beverage processing employment will decrease to 225 100 in 2017-18, which is a decrease of 3.7 per cent from the 2009-10 level. Over this same period, the proportion of manufacturing workers in the food and beverage processing sector is expected to rise to 25.4 per cent. As a proportion of total employment, however, food and beverage processing is expected to decline from 2.1 per cent to 1.8 per cent in 2017-18, reflecting the expected stronger growth in other sectors of the economy.<sup><a href="#fn_31" id="fnr_31">31</a></sup></p>

<p><strong><a href="#tbl_2-5">Table 2.5</a></strong> outlines the employment forecasts by select food and beverage groups. The seafood processing industry is forecast to experience the greatest decline in employment, a 9.1 per cent decline from 2009-10 to 2017-18. The oils and fats manufacturing industry is the only industry that is not expected to experience a decline in employment from 2009-10 to 2017-18.</p>
<p>It should be noted that any forecasted value should be viewed with caution. Estimates are based on historical data and various assumptions on future growth. These forecasts are subject to high levels of variability, particularly when viewing more disaggregated data, such as that used here. While estimates relating to broad categories are more likely to be more accurate, employment levels in individual subdivisions are less likely to follow those forecasted by CoPS.</p>

<h4 id="h4_13">2.3.2 Economic modelling</h4>
<p>The Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education has commissioned economic modelling and analysis by the Centre for International Economics (CIE) on some of the challenges and opportunities facing the food processing industry.<sup><a href="#fn_32" id="fnr_32">32</a></sup> Specifically, the CIE has examined pessimistic, business-as-usual and optimistic scenarios to quantify the challenges and opportunities faced by the food processing industry.<sup><a href="#fn_33" id="fnr_33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>Using a general equilibrium model of the Australian economy that quantitatively captures the behaviour and interactions of supply, demand and prices in the Australian economy and its industry sectors (including the food and beverage processing industry and its sub-groups), the CIE has developed three distinct scenarios - pessimistic, business-as-usual and optimistic - for the Australian food processing industry to 2020 in order to examine the impacts on production and exports. The model quantifies the challenges facing the sector to identify what needs to be done (in terms of broad industry productivity increases, and domestic and foreign demand increases) to lift the pessimistic scenario to the business-as-usual and optimistic scenarios.</p>
<p>The optimistic scenario assumes strong global demand growth for food; productivity<sup><a href="#fn_34" id="fnr_34">34</a></sup> growth in the Australian food processing industry; relatively low growth in energy prices; and an easing mining boom in Australia taking the pressure off the Australian dollar and production and input prices. The business-as-usual scenario assumes average long-run productivity growth in the food processing industry and average long-run productivity growth in the mining sector. The pessimistic scenario assumes increasing strength in the mining sector (and therefore increasing pressure on capital and input prices); increasing energy prices; sluggish growth in international demand for food as well as below average long-run productivity growth in Australia's food industry, leading to increased import pressure.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#tbl_2-6">Table 2.6</a></strong> outlines the CIE simulation results in terms of the percentage change (annual and over eight years to 2020) in food production by sub-sector under the three separate scenarios.</p>
<p>For the pessimistic scenario, results indicate that the food processing industry has some resilience under adversity in terms of changes in production. A pessimistic scenario involving high mining-sector productivity, low food-industry productivity and increasing energy prices sees only modest retractions (-2.73 per cent over eight years and -0.35 per cent annually) in processed food output over the next eight years to 2020.</p>
<p>There are variations across the food processing sub-groups within the food processing industry, however. Other food product manufacturing and dairy product manufacturing experience the largest retractions (-7.44 per cent and -4.81 per cent respectively) over eight years to 2020. Flour, confectionary and biscuit manufacturing and oil and fat manufacturing, however, experience <em>expansions</em> of 4.69 per cent and 1.77 per cent respectively over eight years to 2020 under the pessimistic scenario. The results also vary by state. Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia all experience contractions in processed food production. Victoria and New South Wales, however, expand under the pessimistic scenario.</p>

<p>Under the business-as-usual scenario, however, the food processing industry expands by 8.63 per cent over eight years to 2020 (refer to <strong><a href="#tbl_2-6">Table 2.6</a></strong>). It also outperforms the agricultural sector (3.40 per cent growth over eight years). Compared to the pessimistic scenario, the business-as-usual scenario predicts that industry output will be approximately 11.5 per cent higher. The fruit and vegetable product manufacturing sub-groups expand the most relative to other sub-groups over the eight years to 2020.</p>
<p>Under the optimistic scenario, the food processing industry expands by nearly 30 per cent over eight years to 2020 (refer to <strong><a href="#tbl_2-6">Table 2.6</a></strong>). Under this scenario, the Australian mining sector contracts while the Australian food processing industry experiences rapid productivity growth close to its historical upper productivity growth bound. Export demand is growing and only relatively modest increases in energy prices are experienced. All sub-groups within the food processing industry experience relatively strong growth, with fruit and vegetable product manufacturing and other food product manufacturing being outstanding performers in terms of output growth.</p>
<p>The differences in the change in production across the scenarios are mostly explained by differences in the change in exports of food products which are highly sensitive to prices. While annual growth in domestic consumption of processed foods increases from 1.7 per cent in the pessimistic scenario to a modest 2 per cent in the business-as-usual and optimistic scenarios, annual growth in exports of processed foods increases, from -10.5 per cent in the pessimistic scenario (low industry productivity) to -1 per cent in the business-as-usual scenario (average industry productivity) to 9 per cent in the optimistic scenario (high industry productivity - refer to <strong><a href="#fig_2-31">Figure 2.31</a></strong>), indicating that growth in exports is highly influenced by productivity growth in the food processing industry, as it leads to falls in prices and hence enables manufacturers and their products to be more price-competitive internationally.</p>

<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>If all scenarios discussed thus far are feasible, then an obvious challenge would be to avoid the pessimistic outcome. The CIE measured the extent of such a challenge by assessing the change required in key factors (such as improvements in productivity and increases in export demand) over which industry and government may have some control.</p>
<p>To avoid the pessimistic scenario and stay close to the business-as-usual situation would require either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food processing industry productivity to grow by 1.43 per cent per annum (or 11.92 per cent over eight years to 2020) - an additional 0.85 per cent annually, relative to the assumed growth of 0.5 per cent assumed in the pessimistic scenario; or</li>
<li>Export demand to increase to 7.2 per cent per annum - an additional 5.7 per cent annually, relative to the assumed growth of 1.5 per cent assumed in the pessimistic scenario.<sup><a href="#fn_35" id="fnr_35">35</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Lifting the annual productivity growth rate by an additional 0.85 per cent annually is not an unrealistic target given historical achievements. Lifting export demand growth from 1.5 per cent to 7.2 per cent is a big target, however, and if it were to be achieved, would probably require improvements in market access through reduced trade protectionism and a significant focus on export markets. Alternatively, a combination of the two, such as doubling productivity growth rates (a 0.5 per cent increase) and doubling export demand (a 1.5 per cent rise) would also achieve the output of the business-as-usual scenario.</p>
<p>To achieve growth captured by the optimistic scenario would require either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food processing industry productivity to grow by 2.58 per cent per annum (or 22.36 per cent over eight years to 2020) - an additional 1.42 per cent annually, relative to the assumed growth of 1 per cent assumed in the business-as-usual scenario; or</li>
<li>Export demand to increase to 10.78 per cent a year - an additional 8.78 per cent annually, relative to the assumed growth of 2 per cent assumed in the business-as-usual scenario.<sup><a href="#fn_36" id="fnr_36">36</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>These are big challenges. It would require more than a doubling in productivity growth and more than a five-fold increase in export demand growth. Of course this challenge could be dissected into various combinations of both factors; however, they would still represent very large increases above business-as-usual growth rates. For this to be feasible, it would require a boom in Asian demand (and Asian income growth) for Australian processed foods. It would be akin to what the mining sector is experiencing currently. It would also require improvements in market access through substantial reductions in trade protectionism favouring Australian processed food products.</p>
<h4>Opportunities for productivity gains</h4>
<p>As identified in the previous discussion, increasing productivity is probably the most important and achievable target the industry can pursue to face challenges and pursue opportunities. Productivity improvements are most likely to be achieved through:</p>
<ul>
<li>removing regulatory impediments through regulatory reform</li>
<li>adopting emerging technologies and capital with embodied productivity improvements which may also require removing regulatory and cultural impediments relating to technologies such as gene technology, nanotechnology and irradiation</li>
<li>achieving greater economies of scale through growth, amalgamations and vertical integration</li>
<li>raising labour productivity by investing in a skilled labour force</li>
<li>investing in R&amp;D that leads to the development of new processing technologies and</li>
<li>working collaboratively with agriculture suppliers to increase agricultural productivity to lower the costs of agricultural inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raising export demand to capitalise on the growth in Asian countries is most likely to require:</p>
<ul>
<li>continued activity by government to reduce trade barriers, making it easier to access new markets and building the Australia brand and</li>
<li>targeted consumer insight research as well as targeted consumer marketing to produce products that appeal to consumer tastes and dietary preferences and capitalising on Australia's reputation as a safe and clean food producer.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more strategic alignment of industry and government assets to help drive exports is also likely to improve industry's ability to enter these new export markets. However, it should be noted that Asian markets are not a tabular rasa, i.e. many MNEs, including those that have a presence in Australia, already have a presence in those Asian markets, hence the ongoing need for Australian food manufacturers to improve their competitiveness.</p>
<h3 id="h3_14">2.4 Summary</h3>
<p>The key economic features of the Australian food processing industry are:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a total of 13 015 businesses across ten ANZSIC Groups in the food and beverage processing sector. Small and medium-sized enterprises comprise 98.5 per cent of the food and beverage processing industry</li>
<li>The food and beverage processing sector is the largest employer within the manufacturing sector and has recorded relatively strong growth. Declines are forecast by 2017-18</li>
<li>The bulk of the sector's employment is in the traditionally industrial and agricultural states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland</li>
<li>In 2010-11, the food and beverage processing sector exported $16.97 billion worth of goods, while food and beverage processing imports were $10.43 billion. This represented net exports of $6.54 billion worth of food and beverage products</li>
<li>Australia's Asian neighbours provide a significant opportunity for future market growth</li>
<li>Food and beverage processing gross value added is growing and is the largest contributor to total manufacturing gross value added in Australia</li>
<li>Gross value added per worker from 2003 to 2010 in the food and beverage processing sector has been on the decline, falling on average by 1.3 per cent each year. Over this same period the manufacturing industry and the overall economy have grown by 1.4 and 0.8 per cent respectively</li>
<li>Food manufacturers should focus on increasing their productivity as it is one of the main factors within the control of industry and is essential to remaining competitive and viable in the long-run. Manufacturers could also focus on increasing exports of their products to capitalise on demand growth in Asian countries</li>

<!-- chapter 3 -->
<h2 id="h2_10">3. Current Operating Environment</h2>
<p>This chapter examines the forces affecting the industry's current operating environment. Like most of Australia's manufacturing sector, the food industry is facing challenging times, and there is now a new norm of a high Australian dollar and a strong resource sector. A review of the food manufacturing performance is followed by discussion of a number of environmental factors that affect the industry, such as the cost of direct inputs like raw material, labour, packaging; transport, water and energy costs; the cost of assets and investments; cost of overheads such as marketing and advertising; and the structure of the retail sector.</p>
<h3 id="h3_15">3.1 Financial Performance</h3>
<p>At the outset it should be noted that as the vast majority of food businesses are private companies, financial information is not generally available at a high level of granularity. In addition, any official data at a disaggregated level is provided too late to observe current trends necessary to enable appropriate and immediate action. In addition, governments must comply with the Information Privacy Principles when sharing private data that may have been provided to them. As a result, much of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is provided in aggregate terms.</p>
<p>Studies such as the Food and Beverage Industry CEO Survey<sup><a href="#fn_37" id="fnr_37">37</a></sup> can provide insight on a small scale about how the industry margins have been tracking in what have been challenging trading conditions over the last three years. Eighty-two Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) interviewed as part of the study discussed their views on the industry, including financial performance. A key measure of financial performance used in the survey was Return on Assets (RoA). RoA is a measure of Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) over total assets in a given financial year. RoA is therefore important to identifying profitability with regard to assets. For CEOs surveyed, RoA was approximately 10 to 15 per cent<sup><a href="#fn_38" id="fnr_38">38</a></sup> (<strong><a href="#tbl_3-1">Table 3.1</a></strong>).</p>

<p>In addition to RoA, measuring the changes in EBITDA as a margin of total revenue for firms within the sector enables one to identify if profitability in firms (and the industry more broadly) is shifting. It is therefore an important tool to characterise the health of the food manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>Considering the size of the industry, data extracted from IBISWorld of the top 70 food companies (which fall within the top 2000 companies by revenue) operating within Australia were analysed, to identify key characteristics of the sector. From 2000 to 2011, fluctuations are evident in average EBITDA as a portion of total revenue (<strong><a href="#fig_3-1">Figure 3.1</a></strong>):</p>
<ul>
<li>From 2000 to 2007 EBITDA fluctuated between 10 per cent and 11 per cent. Post-GFC there was a decline from 11 per cent to 9.5 per cent in 2009. Then from 2009 to 2010, there was an increase in EBITDA to 13.6 per cent. However, it is important to note in this period a smaller sample of companies was analysed (29)<sup><a href="#fn_39" id="fnr_39">39</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p id="fig_3-1">Figure 3.1: EBITDA Margins - Food Manufacturers</p>

<br /><a href="#des_32">Text description for EBITDA Margins - Food Manufacturers</a></p>
<p>Similar to EBITDA margins, fluctuations in gross operating profits (another measure of performance) are also evident for the sector. Based on seasonally adjusted gross operating profit data in the 2011 Business Indicators publication (collated by the ABS), a general increase in gross operating profits is evident for the food manufacturing sector annually. Profits peaked (at $2148 million) in 2010, but there has been a decline of approximately $608 million from 2010 to December 2011 (to $1540 million) (<strong><a href="#fig_3-2">Figure 3.2</a></strong>).</p>
<p id="fig_3-2">Figure 3.2: Gross Operating Profits - Food Manufacturers in Australia</p>

<p>Analysis of the annual gross profit changes in the food manufacturing sector in Australia, in comparison to overall manufacturing, suggests relatively consistent outcomes. During and post-GFC (2008-2010), however, important differences are evident (<strong><a href="#fig_3-3">Figure 3.3</a></strong>):</p>
<ul>
<li>During 2009 a significant decline in manufacturing (excluding food) is evident (27 per cent), however the decline in the food manufacturing sector was least evident (12.7 per cent); and</li>
<li>In 2010, a significant increase in the food manufacturing sector is evident, despite a steady decline in manufacturing overall (excluding food). More recently, the trend has been downward, although ostensibly not very sharply</li>
<li>It is important to note that the increase in gross operating profits during this period may be explained by several factors. Importantly, increases for several food-related commodities are evident during this period,<sup><a href="#fn_40" id="fnr_40">40</a></sup> particularly sheep meat, sugar and wheat, of which the value of outputs increased in comparison to the previous year. It is also important to note here that no significant positive or negative statistical pattern on profitability is yet evident.</li>
</ul>

<p>Global analysis of the food sector suggests that Australia is marginally behind. In a report prepared by UBS Securities Australia, <em>Exploring Treasure Island</em>, the performance of several key competitors in the food manufacturing sector was analysed. One of the key findings of this report concluded that Australia presents the lowest average percentage of Earnings Before, Interest and Tax (EBIT) margins (13.8 per cent) in comparison to the global average of 15.9 per cent for the period 2008-2011.<sup><a href="#fn_41" id="fnr_41">41</a></sup> (<strong><a href="#fig_3-4">Figure 3.4</a></strong>).</p>

<h3 id="h3_16">3.2 Direct Inputs</h3>
<h4 id="h4_14">3.2.1 Raw materials</h4>
<p>Notwithstanding that some of the key inputs into food processing manufacture are internationally traded commodities and that Australia is therefore a price-taker in this context, Australian manufacturers do enjoy some cost advantage in some ingredients.</p>
<p>The CIE<sup><a href="#fn_42" id="fnr_42">42</a></sup> has computed the revealed comparative advantage (RCA)<sup><a href="#fn_43" id="fnr_43">43</a></sup> for selected countries or regions by processed and unprocessed food products based on 2007 figures. A country that has a RCA value <em>greater</em> than one for a product indicates that the product from this country had a comparative advantage, because the export share of the product in the country is greater than the world average share of the product. In contrast, a RCA of <em>less</em> than one indicates a comparative disadvantage because its export share is lower than the world average share.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#fig_3-5">Figure 3.5</a></strong> shows the countries with strong revealed comparative advantage.<sup><a href="#fn_44" id="fnr_44">44</a></sup> It should be noted the scales are different for each graph. It reveals that Australia had a strong comparative advantage in beef (represented as bovine meat), sheep meat (represented as cattle/sheep), dairy, wine (represented as bev or tob) and wheat. In comparison, New Zealand had a very strong comparative advantage in most food categories, especially in dairy and beef.</p>
<p>Countries listed in <strong><a href="#fig_3-6">Figure 3.6</a></strong> generally faced comparative disadvantages in more products than they held advantages, and countries listed in <strong><a href="#fig_3-7">Figure 3.7</a></strong> faced no comparative advantages at all. Notably, China had no comparative advantage in any processed and unprocessed food products listed, except for livestock. Similarly, the South-East Asian region had no comparative advantage in processed food products where Australia had a comparative advantage, such as dairy, beef, or other processed meats. Japan had no comparative advantage in any food products (<strong><a href="#fig_3-7">Figure 3.7</a></strong>) and is a major importer of processed and unprocessed food from Australia.</p>
<p>In 2007 the Australian dollar ranged from 78 to 90 US cents. With the dollar around parity, the opportunities for Australia to capitalise on its comparative advantage have lessened significantly. Australian businesses are now citing the lack of availability of affordable raw materials as a major factor in reduced Australian competitiveness. Lately, the high Australian dollar has meant that imported raw material costs have increased and Australian raw material costs may be considerably higher than in competitor countries and, as a result, it has been harder for suppliers to compete with imports.</p>

<p><img src="./images/fig_045.jpg" alt="An illustration of two bar diagrams depicting  RCA measure of Japan and rest of Asia." /></p>
<p>Recently, the cost of raw materials has been cited by some large multinationals (such as SPC Ardmona, Heinz and National Foods) as one of the principal reasons for the closure of local food processing factories in Australia.<sup><a href="#fn_45" id="fnr_45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>Australia can produce better quality products than those it can import; however, unless the consumer is concerned about quality over price, or is aware of the differences in quality, or the origins of key inputs into the finished product, this is unlikely to be an important factor. Imported food and packaging inputs are currently often cheaper than Australian inputs.</p>
<p>Foreign competitors are frequently assisted by their governments through farm intervention and export subsidies to overcome the disadvantage caused by having to use more expensive raw materials. Unfortunately, as <a href="#h2_9"><strong>Chapter Two</strong></a> indicated, the extent of these subsidies is unknown.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are other reasons to import inputs, such as seasonality, insufficient domestic supply or no domestic growing capability. However, many Australian manufacturers would prefer to use Australian product due to the reliability of supply, closeness to market, freshness and quality attributes. Once local production capacity is lost, Australian processors have no option but to import.</p>
<p>In 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted an industry survey on behalf of the DIISRTE to gain insights into issues. While the survey was not statistically significant because of its small sample size (92), raw materials were found to be by far the greatest cost component within this sector (60 respondents claimed this made up more than 20 per cent of their costs), and the increasing cost of raw materials was seen as a reason for preventing investment in business. In addition, productivity in agriculture has been relatively stagnant for a number of years. The fluctuating price of raw materials/produce was seen to be a key challenge for 80 of 92 businesses surveyed by PwC, since they form one of the largest components of a business's costs. Innovation to improve yields and productivity in this area must therefore be seen as a priority.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, businesses surveyed acknowledged the quality of Australian produce - inputs to production and finished goods - (86 businesses agreed with the statement that Australia is strongly associated with producing good quality food). In fact, two-thirds of them claimed that they gained a competitive edge by using the label 'Australian made, Australian grown' where appropriate. So, despite the perceived costliness of utilising Australian products, 87 businesses claimed they used them to an extent. Three in ten businesses claimed they used between 81-100 per cent Australian-made or grown products. The fruit/veg and dairy industries were more likely to use Australian products, and the seafood, oil/fat and grain/cereal industries were least likely to use a large percentage of Australian-made or grown inputs.</p>
<p>Australia has a reputation for supplying clean and natural products with low chemical residues. Surprisingly perhaps, while 'Australia has a major asset in the willingness of international consumers to expect quality, natural and "safe" foods from Australia, such as wine, many Australian foods and beverage producers are not exploiting more effectively this positive pre-disposition of international consumers'.<sup><a href="#fn_46" id="fnr_46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>Importing inputs on an opportunistic basis because of price continues to be a risk to the continuity of supply from domestic growers. In addition, economies of scale in some industries are difficult to achieve because of distance, geographic and topographic reasons. For example, potato production in Tasmania, compared to the Canterbury plains in New Zealand, is limited by the lack of flat land. In addition, Australian road transport regulations and the width of roads can prevent the use of large-scale machinery such as multi-row potato harvesters which provide greater efficiencies.</p>
<p>Despite this, some niche marketers have been able to undertake innovative product development and marketing to enable them to compete in value-sensitive markets despite raw materials being near or at world parity price, e.g. Harvey Fresh (see <a href="#h2_9"><strong>Chapter Two</strong></a>).</p>
<h4 id="h4_15">3.2.2 People and skills</h4>
<p>The PwC survey found that survey respondents had some difficulty in attracting employees across all skill levels.<sup><a href="#fn_47" id="fnr_47">47</a></sup> In particular, 53 businesses of the 92 interviewed claimed they had difficulty in attracting engineers, and 46 respondents claimed they had difficulty in attracting food technologists. However, over a third of all respondents also had difficulty in attracting production workers and plant maintenance workers. It should also be noted that difficulties in recruiting workers can be expected at a time of relatively low unemployment and strong competition for labour from other sectors.</p>
<p>Strategy Group members have also noted the need for more leadership and business training, especially for SMEs. The call for an increased emphasis on this aspect of training is supported by findings from Enterprise Connect SME business surveys.</p>
<p>When compared with both the overall manufacturing industry and the Australian economy, the food and beverage workforce is comprised of a relatively high proportion of low-skilled workers.<sup><a href="#fn_48" id="fnr_48">48</a></sup> Roughly two-thirds of the food and beverage workforce is classed as lower skill, and the employment of managers and professionals is lower than other areas of manufacturing, making up only 18.6 per cent of the labour force (compared to 34.8 per cent in the overall labour force). The industry is characterised by fewer workers with a tertiary qualification and an over-representation of workers with no post-school education.</p>
<p>Forecasts made by the Centre of Policy Studies suggest that while employment in the food and beverage sector will decline by an average of 0.4 per cent per year to 2017-18, in terms of educational attainment,<sup><a href="#fn_49" id="fnr_49">49</a></sup> tertiary-educated workers in the food and beverage processing sector are likely to grow by 17.1 per cent from 2009-10 to 2017-18 (5900 persons) and vocationally educated persons to increase by 5.8 per cent (4500 persons). Some firms are currently filling employment gaps by employing overseas-trained food scientists.</p>
<p>The expected decline in unqualified workers will result in this group representing 46.0 per cent of the food and beverage processing workforce, which is significantly less than the 52.4 per cent in 2009-10.</p>

<h5>Technical skills</h5>
<p>Food Science and Biotechnology studies in higher education system have remained relatively steady in recent years (see <strong><a href="#tbl_3-2">Table 3.2</a></strong>). After a period of declining enrolments, commencements in Food Science and Biotechnology have increased by 6.1 per cent from 2009 to 2010. Enrolments in Food Science and Biotechnology have increased by 1.3 per cent from 2539 in 2009 to 2572 in 2010. Completions in Food Science and Biotechnology have increased by 11.9 per cent from 674 in 2009 to 754 in 2010.</p>

<p>However, in the five years to 2010 there was an 8.0 per cent decrease in commencements; a 15.4 per cent decrease in enrolments and a 7.5 per cent decrease in completions for Food Science and Biotechnology student (<strong>see <a href="#tbl_3-5">Table 3.5</a></strong>). This is in contrast to a rising trend in the number of student enrolments and completions in nutrition related courses. Industry advice is that Food Science graduates are invariably employed within the food industry, although not perhaps in roles as researchers but rather in quality assurance. A number of organisations have identified this problem and have developed initiatives that are attempting to address it but there is no mechanism to coordinate and capture synergies between these disconnected but otherwise useful activities. Examples include initiatives by Australian Institute of Food Science Technology (AIFST), AFGC - outlined below - Food Technology Association of Australia (FTAA), and several state governments.</p>
<p>The reason that few students elect to study the food sciences could be due in part to the negative perceptions of suitable work available within the sector for qualified individuals and the lack of a clear career path in food science and technology.<sup><a href="#fn_50" id="fnr_50">50</a></sup> Other factors include low remuneration and poor career options. Demand for locally trained food scientists is also trending downwards due perhaps to a perception of declining standards in locally trained food scientists and/or a declining aggregate demand for local R&amp;D.<sup><a href="#fn_51" id="fnr_51">51</a></sup> A survey of industry employers conducted by the Allen Consulting Group on behalf of the FTAA confirmed that many food science and technology graduates do not possess the technical skills employers consider important.<sup><a href="#fn_52" id="fnr_52">52</a></sup> Indeed, a report prepared by the Australian Institute of Food Science and Technology (AIFST) noted that the introduction of more nutrition-based subject areas in food science and technology courses at the expense of engineering and other fundamental food science subjects may not equip graduates with the knowledge and skills to be effective food scientists/technologists.<sup><a href="#fn_53" id="fnr_53">53</a></sup></p>
<p>The 2011 survey conducted by the Allen Consulting Group observed that the majority of survey respondents believe that it will become more difficult to recruit suitable food science and technology graduates domestically in the next five years.<sup><a href="#fn_54" id="fnr_54">54</a></sup> Currently, this may not present too much of a risk to the food industry which is not generally looking to expand its R&amp;D profile because of present economic conditions, and which can source food science graduates from overseas on 457 visas. However, in the medium to longer term the lack of domestic supply of suitable food scientists poses a significant risk to an industry looking to significantly expand its R&amp;D capacity and capabilities, not least to exploit the opportunities of the Asian century.</p>
<h5>UQ-AFGC partnership to overcome technical shortages</h5>
<p>In October 2010, the University of Queensland (UQ) and the AFGC announced the establishment of the AFGC Chair in Food Sciences and Technology, and a partnership to address the growing demand for high calibre food science and technology graduates and raise the profile of food science and technology courses. An industry advisory committee will provide advice on industry training and education needs. The initiative will also encompass an industry-sponsored scholarship scheme to develop better linkages with education providers and industry and attract undergraduate and graduate students to undertake industry placements in food companies as part of their degree programs.</p>
<p>In 2011 the University of Tasmania, the CSIRO and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) announced a collaboration to develop a new centre for food innovation at the DSTO site in Scottsdale, Tasmania.</p>
<p>Initiatives such as these are crucial for supporting the viability of food science and technology courses. Indeed, the AIFST noted that continued university support for food science and technology courses with low student enrolments will require more support from industry in the form of sponsored scholarships and academic positions.</p>
<h5>Production skills</h5>
<p>The Australian Vocational Education and Training (VET) system provides training across a wide range of subject areas relevant to the food processing industry. It is delivered through a variety of training institutions and enterprises. The courses are managed and accredited by various national and state authorities.<sup><a href="#fn_55" id="fnr_55">55</a></sup></p>
<p>AgriFood Skills Australia is one of 11 independent, not-for-profit Industry Skills Councils established by the DIISRTE. It is led by industry and funded by the Australian Government, and is charged with driving the skills and workforce development agenda across five main sectors including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rural and related industries (including agriculture, horticulture, conservation and land management, animal care and management)</li>
<li>Food, beverage and pharmaceutical processing</li>
<li>Meat</li>
<li>Seafood and</li>
<li>Racing (greyhound, thoroughbred and harness).</li>
</ul>
<p>AgriFood Skills Australia data from 2005 to 2009 appears to confirm that there has been a decline in students (excluding apprentices/trainees) commencing VET courses relating to the food processing industry, from approximately 8000 students in 2005 to approximately 4000 students in 2009.<sup><a href="#fn_56" id="fnr_56">56</a></sup> This trend contrasts to the number of all students completing their VET courses in the food processing industry, which appears to have been relatively stable from 2005 to 2008.</p>
<p>The training commencements and completions of apprentices and trainees in the food processing sector appear relatively stable from 2005 to 2009, and it seems that a relatively larger proportion of apprentices and trainees commencing an apprenticeship are completing their apprenticeships than there are students commencing a general VET qualification.</p>
<p>In 2009 the majority of students and apprentices/trainees in the food processing sector were located in, and were undertaking training, in the major cities and inner regional areas. The regional location of the industry's workforce poses particular problems for attracting, developing and retaining an appropriate workforce with the specific skills needed to meet industry sector requirements. One of the main difficulties is the sustainability of the provision of vocational education and training in regional areas with small education markets. This is exacerbated by projections of further decreases in the 15 to 24-year age group in many regional areas.<sup><a href="#fn_57" id="fnr_57">57</a></sup> Online training via the National Broadband Network could alleviate problems with distance training.</p>
<p>The majority of food processing industry VET graduates are either active in the food processing industry (approximately one-third of all food processing graduates), or are active in other (non agrifood-related) industries (approximately one-third of all food processing graduates).<sup><a href="#fn_58" id="fnr_58">58</a></sup> If graduates employed in the meat processing, rural and seafood industries are considered, then over half of all food processing industry graduates are active in agrifood-related occupations six months after education and training.</p>
<p>Only a relatively small proportion of food processing VET graduates is unemployed or not in the labour force post-completion.</p>
<p>This data gives the impression that the majority of food processing graduates remain or are employed in their area of industry specialisation post-completion. However, it also implies that not all graduates remain or are employed in the industry related to their training package post-completion - hence relevant skills are not entirely captured and retained by the sponsor industry.</p>
<p>For the food, beverages and pharmaceuticals industry (no separate data is available for the food processing industry alone), the number of students enrolled in food-related VET qualifications as a proportion of the food, beverages and pharmaceuticals labour force (4.1 per cent) is relatively lower than in any other agrifood industry, including the seafood industry (5.2 per cent), the rural and agriculture industries (8.1 per cent), and the meat industry (7.9). It is also much lower than the proportion of the entire labour force undertaking accredited training (15.5 per cent).</p>
<p>The Strategy Group was told that the ongoing training of basic skills at an operator level was essential but inadequate. The National Food Institute was acknowledged as a good Registered Training Authority (RTO) model but was considered to be under-promoted. Some Strategy Group members thought that the VET system was too inflexible, and that many Registered Training Organisations (RTO) were delivering training programs that delivered on the RTOs' needs, their business plan etc, rather than the needs of industry. It is unclear whether the shortfall in education and training is being compensated for by unaccredited in-house training and on-the-job training, which is currently outside the scope of the national VET data collection.</p>
<p>Effects of a decline in graduate numbers (including suitably qualified and skilled graduates) and the inability of the Australian processing food sector to attract and retain skilled labour, especially in regional communities, are a potential reduction in the ability to innovate and increase productivity.</p>

<h4 id="h4_16">3.2.3 Packaging</h4>
<p>'Packaging fulfils an important role in our lives. It protects food and other goods on their journey from farm or factory via warehouses and shops until they arrive at homes, offices or wherever they are used. A key role of packaging is to avoid spoilage and damage in the supply system and in the home. And yet, recent surveys show that consumers believe packaging is the top environmental problem in relation to the products they buy. Alongside addressing these concerns, packaging policy needs to contribute to greater resource efficiency and the fight against climate change, as part of the wider goal to reduce the overall environmental impacts of our supply chains'.<sup><a href="#fn_59" id="fnr_59">59</a></sup></p>
<p>Based on consumer needs, manufacturers and packers continue to invest in developing packaging that is convenient, eco-friendly and protects products. Innovation in design, materials and efficiency serves to meet cost and environmental concerns, as well as convenience, shelf-life and safety issues.</p>
<p>Demographic change has impacted on packaging needs for convenience food, non-food and beverages. The growing population of older consumers is leading packers to introduce packaging more suited to the needs of the elderly, such as being easier to open and lighter, as well as introducing spill-proof closures and labelling which is easier to read.</p>
<p>In the 2011 PwC industry survey, 31 firms surveyed thought that consumers' purchases were driven by goods with a longer shelf-life and 29 companies indicated consumer purchase was driven by a desire for improved packaging.<sup><a href="#fn_60" id="fnr_60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>'Packaging has an important marketing role. It is the "flag-bearer" of branded products. Packaging also plays an important role in differentiating competing products and can be decisive in influencing the purchasing choice made by consumers. The package as a deliverer of brand equity has to work not only on the retail shelf but "online" as well'.<sup><a href="#fn_61" id="fnr_61">61</a></sup></p>
<p>There are three broad categories of packaging in the food processing industry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consumer packaging or primary packaging: that is, packaging which constitutes a sales unit to the final user or consumer at the point of purchase.</li>
<li>Grouped packaging or secondary packaging: or, packaging which constitutes, at the point of purchase, a grouping of a certain number of sales units, whether the latter is sold as such to the final user, or consumer, or whether it serves only as a means to replenish the shelves at the point of sale. It can be removed from the product without affecting its characteristics.</li>
<li>Transport packaging or tertiary packaging: that is, packaging designed to facilitate handling and transport of a number of sales units or grouped packaging in order to prevent physical handling and transport damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Increasingly, manufacturers are looking to merge - or better coordinate - the functions performed by these levels of packaging in order to reduce costs and facilitate good presentation. Packaging suppliers are helping to develop innovative ways to achieve this, with the total cost being less than the sum of the original parts and with functionality either unimpaired or improved.<sup><a href="#fn_62" id="fnr_62">62</a></sup></p>
<p>However, the Packaging Council of Australia acknowledges that changes in the packaging environment have occurred rapidly, with retailers now constituting the largest brand-owners; rapidly growing packaging imports from low-cost countries (such as China), and moves to package overseas. Despite this, packaging remains a fertile area for further R&amp;D in Australia.</p>
<p>Food packaging is a significant contributor to waste.<sup><a href="#fn_63" id="fnr_63">63</a></sup> According to the Environment Protection Heritage Council (EPHC) in 2006-07 Australia generated 43.8 million tonnes of solid waste of which 4.4 million tonnes was packaging. In the food industry, while the growing demand for smaller product sizes has increased packaging waste, retailers are also contributing to increased packaging waste by requesting secondary packaging to reduce labour costs in stocking shelves. Despite this, 'waste reduction continues to be a driver for changes in food packaging, both within food processing itself and beyond (e.g. transportation and shelf-life). Companies note that waste reduction can be expected to result in cost savings (less material required and reduced waste disposal costs). There is considerable interest in reducing the loss of product from packaging failures both within the food processing plant and in transport. This is linked to the quality of packaging, with some companies reporting unsatisfactory performance from imported materials'.<sup><a href="#fn_64" id="fnr_64">64</a></sup></p>
<p>Some industry stakeholders believe that consumers have only a superficial understanding of sustainability in relation to food packaging. Sustainability goes well beyond recyclability to include such issues as the carbon footprint of different packaging materials and the energy costs involved in their recycling. Stakeholders believe that consumers are confused by the various recycling and sustainability logos and seem to accept any claims regarding sustainability. When sustainability comes at a higher cost, consumers tend to buy the lower cost item. This reduces the incentive to invest in more sustainable packaging.<sup><a href="#fn_65" id="fnr_65">65</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="h4_17">3.2.4 Freight</h4>
<p>The food processing industry is one of the dominant users of freight logistics services in Australia, particularly refrigerated freight. Food processing companies comprise 15 of the 33 major logistics users in Australia.<sup><a href="#fn_66" id="fnr_66">66</a></sup> Food comprises a large part of the non-bulk freight task which is projected to grow at nearly 4 per cent annually to 2020, in terms of tonnage kms.<sup><a href="#fn_67" id="fnr_67">67</a></sup></p>
<h5>Routes and modes</h5>
<p>Road dominates the freight task on most major Australian intercity corridors, carrying over three-quarters of the non-bulk freight compared to 20 per cent for rail. The only intercity transport corridors where rail dominates are the Adelaide-Perth and Eastern States-Perth routes (see <strong><a href="#fig_3-9">Figure 3.9</a></strong>).<sup><a href="#fn_68" id="fnr_68">68</a></sup> For a significant fraction of food freight there is no alternative to road transport, as the rail network is far less extensive than the road network. Rail transport has also become a much more expensive option too in some sectors/areas. For example, many abattoirs in Queensland were established near railway lines when Queensland Rail was a State-based asset. Since Queensland Rail's privatisation, rail has become a much more expensive option. Furthermore, the flexibility and reliability of road transport is preferred for time-sensitive food freight, particularly perishable foods.<sup><a href="#fn_69" id="fnr_69">69</a></sup></p>

<p>Food and live animal comprise one third of all road freight cargo on the Melbourne-Brisbane freight corridor.<sup><a href="#fn_70" id="fnr_70">70</a></sup> According to Coles-Myer, most of its rail food cargo is dry foods, whereas their road transport freight is primarily fresh produce.<sup><a href="#fn_71" id="fnr_71">71</a></sup> The Australian government has committed more than $36 billion in land transport infrastructure over the six years to 2013-14 - including road and rail funding. There are current policy reforms that include the creation of single national regulators for heavy vehicles, rail safety, and maritime transport; the National Land Freight Strategy (in development); and the National Ports Strategy.</p>
<h5>Costs</h5>
<p>In a recent survey of the food processing industry 46 of the 83 businesses surveyed identified transport costs as were greater than 5 per cent of total business costs.<sup><a href="#fn_72" id="fnr_72">72</a></sup> Transport costs are likely to be higher for rural-based businesses which have greater transport distances to cover and for SMEs which often have less access to competitive logistics services.</p>
<p>Goodman Fielder, one of Australia's biggest food manufacturers, has suggested that distribution accounts for almost half the delivered cost of the loaves it bakes every day of the week and then trucks to 20 000 retail outlets. These delivery costs amount to 43 per cent of each loaf, well ahead of raw materials at 30 per cent and manufacturing at 27 per cent.<sup><a href="#fn_73" id="fnr_73">73</a></sup></p>
<p>In a study by PwC on food oils and flour milling, commissioned by DIISRTE, transport represented approximately 7 per cent of total costs of production. For one WA mill, its transport expense had increased 15 per cent over the last three years. Stakeholders said these costs are expected to continue to increase at 3.5 per cent per annum. Transport and freight were noted as significant costs and a major concern for the oil-crushing industry - being the industry's third-biggest cost after the raw material and packaging material costs. Crushers stated an average transport cost of $1 000 per tonne, noting that this is higher than the total manufacturing cost. For refiners, transport was the fourth-greatest expense after raw materials, packaging materials and direct labour. Stakeholders also noted there had been large increases in these expenses: crushers had seen transport increase by 6 per cent on average over the last three years.<sup><a href="#fn_74" id="fnr_74">74</a></sup></p>
<h5>Carbon price</h5>
<p>The Australian Government is introducing a carbon price into the Australian economy from July 1 2012. Transport is the fourth-largest contributor to Australia's CO2 emissions, accounting for approximately 15 per cent of total emissions.</p>
<p>The Government will apply an effective carbon price on certain transport businesses, through reductions in existing fuel tax credits for rail, domestic shipping and, from 1 July 2014, for heavy vehicles. Commercial freight (with the exemption of air freight) is not subject to the carbon price in the period 2012-15.</p>
<h5>Retail market concentration effects on transport</h5>
<p>According to a 2003 study by Australian and New Zealand suppliers' and retailers' industry group, Efficient Consumer Response Australasia, optimisation of freight systems could reduce costs to retailers by 15-18 per cent and 4-12 per cent to suppliers.<sup><a href="#fn_75" id="fnr_75">75</a></sup> Subsequently, retailers have led the drive to improved freight efficiency, as suppliers were generally lagging in supply chain reform and retailers had greater potential benefits.<sup><a href="#fn_76" id="fnr_76">76</a></sup> Woolworths' primary freight control initiative is part of its larger Project Refresh which delivered $6 billion worth of savings to the firm in the decade since it started in 1999.<sup><a href="#fn_77" id="fnr_77">77</a></sup></p>
<p>In Australia, suppliers are likely to experience significant adverse effects as a consequence of primary retail freight control,<sup><a href="#fn_78" id="fnr_78">78</a></sup> as both Coles and Woolworths have adopted freight-control strategies and jointly account for 70-80 per cent of domestic dry goods food sales. As of mid-2009, Woolworths controlled 35 per cent of its primary freight task.<sup><a href="#fn_79" id="fnr_79">79</a></sup> A 2004 Australian study by Strategic Design &amp; Development estimated that some suppliers may have their logistics freight volume reduced by 70 per cent, dramatically reducing their buying power for the remainder of the logistics service needs.<sup><a href="#fn_80" id="fnr_80">80</a></sup> A 2011 survey of 82 food manufacturing CEOs found this concern was shared by suppliers of whom 83 per cent, particularly SMEs, believed that power is too concentrated in the supply chain.<sup><a href="#fn_81" id="fnr_81">81</a></sup></p>
<p>One possible option for SMEs is to work cooperatively, to use common distribution networks and jointly commission logistics services for distribution to retailers. This method has been trialled in Finland, where 11 SMEs in the meat and bakery sectors developed two distribution networks, adopted a common online ordering system for logistics services and developed an energy passport to show the eco-value of low transport miles.<sup><a href="#fn_82" id="fnr_82">82</a></sup> The project offered a number of benefits: significant costs savings, greater buying power and access to logistics services, reduced transport mileage, access to new retail markets, and additional knowledge-sharing in selling and promotion of products.</p>
<h4 id="h4_18">3.2.5 Energy</h4>
<p>Meat, dairy, sugar and malt are the biggest energy users. The impact of the carbon tax is expected to be significant for some sectors; for example, the Australian Meat Processor Corporation Ltd<sup><a href="#fn_83" id="fnr_83">83</a></sup> anticipates that the impact of a carbon price across the permit liable plants will be anywhere between $1m - $3.1m per plant in 2010 and rising in future years. This equates to a cost per head of around $5.64 per beef animal and $0.78 per sheep. Based on 2009 slaughter levels, this equates to an increased cost to industry of at least $63.5 million.</p>
<p>However, under-investment in energy infrastructure over past years is likely to have a greater impact. The Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program will allow successful applicants in a number of high carbon-emitting industries, including the meat sector, to invest in new equipment and processes to reduce their emissions and therefore their exposure to the carbon price. Such investment may also allow meat and other manufacturers to reduce the costs of waste treatment from their processes.</p>
<div>
<p>CASE STUDY</p>
<p><strong>Tamburlaine Winery</strong><sup><a href="#fn_a" id="fnr_a">a</a></sup></p>
<p>Tamburlaine Winery in the Hunter Valley has reduced its overall electricity consumption by 48 per cent and refrigeration electricity use by 54 per cent following recommendations from an energy audit. The energy audit conducted through Sustainability Advantage Energy Saver showed refrigeration accounted for 75 per cent of the winery's energy use in 2010 and identified total efficiency savings of $114 000 a year. By improving running time and thermostat controls, upgrading heat exchangers and making pipework modifications, Tamburlaine has saved $54 000 a year and the investment paid for itself in less than 12 months.</p>

<h4 id="h4_19">3.2.6 Water</h4>
<p>Efficient water use is important to the success of the food industry. In Australia, manufacturing as a whole is the second-largest industry user of water, using 5 per cent of the annual water consumption, similar to the mining industry and second only to agriculture which uses 52 per cent.<sup><a href="#fn_84" id="fnr_84">84</a></sup> The food, beverage and tobacco sectors consumed 2.2 per cent (301GL) of national water used, or 46 per cent of water consumed by the manufacturing industry.</p>

<p>The food processing sector has consistently had the highest industry value added (IVA) in the manufacturing industry in the last 15 years. However, while all other sectors have improved water efficiency per IVA since the mid-1990s, water efficiency in the food processing sector has declined by 5 per cent (refer to <strong><a href="#tbl_3-3">Table 3.3</a></strong>).<sup><a href="#fn_85" id="fnr_85">85</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn_86" id="fnr_86">86</a></sup></p>

<p>The major components of water use in food processing are cleaning functions and process operations (see <strong><a href="#fig_3-11">Figure 3.11</a></strong>). Water savings have the potential for significant cost savings, as water heating and wastewater management comprise the bulk of the costs, particularly for water used in cleaning.<sup><a href="#fn_87" id="fnr_87">87</a></sup> To date, water cost rises have not been sufficient to encourage major water savings. However, rising energy costs, waste water treatment costs and projected water cost increases are starting to drive greater water efficiency in the sector.</p>

<h4 id="h4_20">3.2.7 Waste</h4>
<p>Food waste is potentially a source of productivity gains. 'Food waste occurs at different points in the food supply chain, although it is most readily defined at the retail and consumer stages, where outputs of the agricultural system are self-evidently "food" for human consumption.'<sup><a href="#fn_88" id="fnr_88">88</a></sup></p>
<p>Food waste is inextricably linked to other variables in the food chain, including packaging, processing reliability, input variability and quality, the application of R&amp;D and technology transfer. Food is wasted at all stages of the food chain - by producers, processors, retailers, caterers and consumers. One of the greatest waste producers is bakeries. In the UK, of the 8.3 million tonnes of food thrown away every year, bakery waste is the fourth-largest category, with nearly 800 000 tonnes thrown away.<sup><a href="#fn_89" id="fnr_89">89</a></sup></p>
<p>In Australia domestic food waste is very high. According to the Australian Institute,<sup><a href="#fn_90" id="fnr_90">90</a></sup> 'Australians readily admit to spending more than $5 billion a year on food that they throw away', and while it is in the direct financial interests of most households to reduce food waste, many households continue to throw away large quantities of food. This food is the equivalent of enough to feed the entire nation for three weeks. The Institute contends that it is only through government action that the causes and consequences of household waste can be properly addressed because the problem is not a lack of awareness but one of translating this knowledge into behaviour change.</p>
<p>Using 'paddock to plate' calculations, WRAP<sup><a href="#fn_91" id="fnr_91">91</a></sup> in the UK estimates that one ton of food waste generates 3.8 tons of CO2 equivalent emissions. Using the same figures, food waste in Australia is responsible for an estimated 15.4 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions every year. However, there is not only a cost to the atmosphere, but in the inputs to produce the food. CSIRO data indicate that dumping a kilogram of beef wastes the 50 000 litres of water it took to produce that meat and throwing out a kilogram of white rice will waste 2385 litres.</p>
<p>It is not just governments that regard food waste as a major issue. For example, in its submission to the National Food Plan, the Sanitarium Food Company recommended that waste minimisation, including that of water, energy and materials, be a priority for all stakeholders.<sup><a href="#fn_92" id="fnr_92">92</a></sup></p>
<p>The results of the PwC industry survey found that most food processing businesses thought that waste management was fundamental to business. Of the 92 businesses surveyed, 39 indicated that waste management was critical - both commercially and economically (22 per cent for both).</p>
<p>The short shelf-life of products was identified as the primary source of waste produced within the business (by 15); however, poor process control (13) and poor-quality materials (11) were also perceived to be contributing factors. Those businesses within the dairy, grain/cereal, and bakery industries were more likely to claim that short shelf-life is the source of the highest level of waste within their business - which was of little surprise given the nature of their products.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of businesses claimed to have taken some form of action to reduce waste production via their manufacturing and processing methods (48). The second-most likely way businesses had addressed the problem of waste production was to recycle waste products (33). A quarter claimed they had sourced better quality materials (25). Those in the meat, oil/fat, grain/cereal and beverage industries were more likely to have sourced better-quality ingredients (qualitative observation due to low base sizes).</p>
<p>Improved packaging (not necessarily the amount of) can prevent considerable food waste.</p>

<ul>
<li>It has been alleged that some retailers require their suppliers to pack product to even tighter weight specifications than those required by legislation, effectively demanding that no given pack of a product have 'short-weight' even if that shortfall is within the tolerances allowed by regulation. This means that manufacturers would need to lift their average target weight, or rework any product below the minimum weight. This would result in waste and rework and lost productivity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h3_17">3.3 Investment and Asset Costs</h3>
<h4 id="h4_21">3.3.1 Plant and equipment</h4>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s there was significant growth in the variety of processed food products; however, the changing nature this market caused a movement away from standard food machinery products to a diverse market of specialised food machinery (typically smaller machines for specific niche products).</p>
<p>The cost of developing and producing equipment in the food processing industry can be high, as much depends on sophisticated technology. The Australian industry is small. Germany, Italy and the United States are the major sources of imported food processing machinery for the domestic market, with an estimated 54.5 per cent share anticipated by 2015-16.<sup><a href="#fn_93" id="fnr_93">93</a></sup> A high Australian dollar offers opportunity for investment in overseas equipment.</p>
<p>Some Strategy Group members think that the age of the assets of Australian processed food firm's results in higher labour costs compared to similar enterprises overseas. However, a study commissioned by the Prime Minister's Manufacturing Taskforce suggests that: 'there is no obvious problem with the age of capital in manufacturing, [including processed food manufacturing] although again associated with poor trading conditions manufacturing investment has fallen relative to GDP since the Global Financial Crisis'.<sup><a href="#fn_94" id="fnr_94">94</a></sup></p>
<p>By end 2016-17 private capital expenditure on machinery and equipment is expected to have increased at an annualised rate of 5.1 per cent and be worth $135.8 billion.<sup><a href="#fn_95" id="fnr_95">95</a></sup> Analysis of machinery expenditure growth over the last 45 years suggests that the life-cycle exhibits a fairly regular pattern. IBIS World estimates a life-cycle commodity period of approximately eight years.</p>
<p>Today there is an increasing trend to invest in more energy-efficient machinery and equipment in the food and beverage processing sector to save on operating costs and to ensure the longer-term sustainability of the industry.<sup><a href="#fn_96" id="fnr_96">96</a></sup></p>
<p>Beer and malt are largely produced under large-scale factory conditions and are capital-intensive. This sub-sector has the greatest value added per employee in 2008-09 ($481 000 per employee in 2010-11 dollar terms). A large share of bakery production takes place under small-scale operations.<sup><a href="#fn_97" id="fnr_97">97</a></sup> This sub-sector has the lowest value added per employee in 2008-09 ($57 000 per employee in 2010-11 dollar terms.</p>
<p>While maintenance and repairs can be used to extend machinery's effective life, changes and development of new technologies can mean manufacturers can no longer compete with competitors (despite having relatively new equipment) due to commercial obsolescence. This is particularly problematic for SMEs which do not have the necessary capital to adapt to these changes. In many cases manufacturers may continue with operations at reduced productivity levels and profit margins rather than abandon the asset altogether.</p>
<p>In the 2011 PwC industry survey, of the 92 businesses surveyed, the majority claimed to invest in innovation (80); however, most of the investment was below 5 per cent of total costs (55). The areas of the business which seemed to receive most of the innovation investment were plant improvements (73), new product formulations (60) and product extensions (52).</p>
<p>The development of new processing techniques can influence the nature of products, especially when they extend their life or enhance flavour. There is great diversity in the food processing sector and the type of machinery used is often highly specialised and sometimes purpose-built.</p>
<p>IBISWorld estimates major markets for Australian machinery uptake are the meat and seafood processing sectors.<sup><a href="#fn_98" id="fnr_98">98</a></sup> These sectors are converting to energy-efficient machinery to reduce operating costs. Upgrades to increase automation have also influenced growth. In fact, food businesses generally are looking to reduce waste and prepare for a carbon price.</p>
<p>The issue with plant and equipment may not be that of its age, but its underutilisation. Of 92 respondents to the PwC survey, 68 said they had the capacity to increase the number of shifts. Forty-seven respondents said that market demand was preventing greater sales, compared to just 21 who said line capacity constraints were the problem. Underutilisation of capital can mean administrative overheads represent a greater portion of unit costs. It is likely greater utilisation of capital would increase productivity. The issue of scale is addressed in <a href="#h2_11"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></a>.</p>
<h4 id="h4_22">3.3.2 Intellectual property</h4>
<p>Overall, the total number of Australian patents granted to Australians has been growing slowly, at approximately 0.8 per cent per annum since 2000.<sup><a href="#fn_99" id="fnr_99">99</a></sup> The technology group quantifying agriculture and food-related machinery is one of the highest areas of patenting in Australia, ranking eighth. However, the agriculture and food patenting (not related to machinery) is typically in the bottom 20 per cent technology group in terms of granted patents in Australia.</p>
<p>As the following table shows post-2006, worldwide applications for Australian patents dropped dramatically.<sup><a href="#fn_100" id="fnr_100">100</a></sup> Based on the number of applications since 2006, we can expect patents awarded to fall in the next few years. Despite this expected slump, food-related patents awarded to Australians have recovered, increasing by approximately 20 per cent, and total food-related patents granted to Australians has grown faster in this area than any other technology group between 2005-2009.However, many patents awarded post 2006 are likely to have been applied for in the period 2003-06, so this increase may reflect to some extent this earlier activity.<sup><a href="#fn_101" id="fnr_101">101</a></sup></p>
<p id="fig_3-12">Figure 3.12: Patent Applications from Australians and all Applicants, 1989-2011</p>
<p><img src="./images/fig_052.jpg" alt="Chart showing Patent Applications from Australians and all Applicants, 1989-2011" /></p>
<p>Source: IP Australia, private communication, 9 Feb 2012.<br /><a href="#des_43">Text description for Patent Applications from Australians and all Applicants, 1989-2011</a></p>
<p>Only 12 per cent of Australian manufacturing firms hold patents.<sup><a href="#fn_102" id="fnr_102">102</a></sup> Food manufacturers comprise two-thirds of manufacturing SMEs; however, only 0.23 per cent of food-manufacturing SMEs have intellectual property investments.<sup><a href="#fn_103" id="fnr_103">103</a></sup> Patent rates, however, do not accurately represent innovation in food manufacturing firms, as patents are not appropriate for most innovation activities by these firms. A significant fraction of food business innovation is likely to be in new formulations, process operations and supply chain management, which is only weakly reflected in R&amp;D expenditure and patenting.</p>
<h4 id="h4_23">3.3.3 Innovation</h4>
<p>R&amp;D funding and patent issuing are important measures of innovative practice, but they measure only one component of innovation and do not track things such as improved business processes, new business models, new services and creative cultural products.<sup><a href="#fn_104" id="fnr_104">104</a></sup></p>
<p>Innovation can be open or closed. Closed innovation is the traditional model. It involves companies undertaking all R&amp;D within the business, requiring control and confidentiality, and not necessarily producing the optimum solutions. Business bears all the costs under this model and similar activities are duplicated across the industry. Intellectual property (IP) which is not used is 'locked up'. Businesses generally innovate when they believe that the effort will bring higher margins and/or accelerated growth, and not for the social and economic benefits of the country as a whole.<sup><a href="#fn_105" id="fnr_105">105</a></sup></p>
<p>Open innovation occurs by combining internal and external ideas, as well as internal and external paths to market, to advance the development of new technologies.<sup><a href="#fn_106" id="fnr_106">106</a></sup>. It involves a flexible approach and an open policy on IP. Access to knowledge and technology from outside the organisation is utilised in order to achieve: shorter development times and 'speed to market'; reduced R&amp;D costs; IP leverage, and co-investment and development of innovation networks.</p>
<p>Process innovation occurs when new or significantly improved production or delivery techniques are employed. A number of Australian governments provide assistance to food businesses to improve processes and share knowledge. For example, Innovate SA and the SA Food Centre work closely with industry to improve process development in South Australia.</p>
<p>Product innovation involves the introduction of any good or service with fundamental characteristics or intended uses that differ significantly from other products or services offered by the industry.</p>
<p>Of the 92 respondents to the PwC survey, 79 claimed they had invested in plant/equipment innovation improvements, 65 had claimed they had invested in new product formulations, 57 had done product extensions.</p>
<p>In Smith and West's view 'Australia has two fundamental needs concerning the future of innovation in Australia. The first is for a modified knowledge infrastructure policy, less focused on direct commercialisation and more orientated towards the generic and scientific knowledge bases that underpin the Australian economy. The second is a modified business development system, addressing the real characteristics of the innovation faced by business(es)'.<sup><a href="#fn_107" id="fnr_107">107</a></sup></p>
<p>Industry consultations indicate that there is a need for the food industry in Australia to create sustainable competitive advantage through innovation along the value chain. Valuable innovation in the food processing industry has occurred in Australia; however, the extent to which it has been shared in the 'open space' is unclear.</p>

<h4 id="h4_24">3.3.4 Research and development</h4>
<p>Australia's food industry has a history of and is capable of being highly innovative and adaptable to new challenges, and its significant R&amp;D<sup><a href="#fn_108" id="fnr_108">108</a></sup> capabilities have the capacity to make it a competitive player in the international markets. As the world's food prices rise (driven by population growth, climate change, 'peak' oil and phosphorous, among other reasons), it is vital that continued investment is made in R&amp;D for the development of new processes and technologies. To encourage R&amp;D the Australian Government provides tax incentives to businesses.</p>
<h5>R&amp;D Tax Incentive</h5>
<p>The current R&amp;D Tax Incentive (which replaced the R&amp;D Tax Concession) applies to income years commencing on or after 1 July 2011. The two core components of the new program are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>45 per cent refundable tax offset</strong> for company groups with aggregated annual turnover of less than $20 million, doubling the support to 15 cents in the dollar and</li>
<li>a <strong>40 per cent non-refundable tax offset</strong> for all other company groups, increasing the base rate support by a third to 10 cents in the dollar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new R&amp;D Tax Incentive features higher base rates of assistance for all genuine R&amp;D conducted by eligible businesses. There is particular emphasis on supporting R&amp;D conducted by smaller businesses and innovative start-up companies. These companies typically need cash flow to support their R&amp;D activities and the new incentive features significantly greater access to refundable tax offsets</p>
<p>To further improve the access to the R&amp;D Tax Incentive for small and medium enterprises, the Government will introduce quarterly credits from 1 January 2014. Quarterly credits will provide smaller firms with the option to receive the benefit of the R&amp;D Tax Incentive as instalments during the income year in which they undertake their R&amp;D activities. This will get the benefit sooner to these enterprises and significantly improve their cash flow and incentive to invest in R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Industry is supportive of the Government's R&amp;D Tax Incentive and many businesses in the food and beverage processing industry will benefit from the assistance provided by the Government.</p>
<p>The new program includes a 'dominant purpose' test for supporting R&amp;D Activities in some circumstances. Generally, supporting R&amp;D activities will be eligible for the R&amp;D offset concession where they are 'activities directly related to core activities'. However, a stricter 'dominant purpose' applies to supporting core R&amp;D activities if the activities: appear on the 'exclusions list' (such as market research, prospecting, management studies, and so on); or are (or directly related to) the production of goods or services. A Strategy Group member has suggested that this requirement may potentially prevent some businesses from applying/accessing this program.</p>
<p>Generally, only R&amp;D activities conducted in Australia qualify for the R&amp;D tax incentive. However, R&amp;D activities conducted overseas also qualify if Innovation Australia makes a finding that the activities meet the conditions specified in section 28D of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986'.</p>
<h5>R&amp;D Expenditure</h5>
<p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, R&amp;D expenditure on food product manufacturing totalled $427.8 million in 2009-10, an increase of approximately 9.9 per cent over the previous year (refer to <strong><a href="#fig_3-13">Figure 3.13</a></strong>). Since 2005-06, R&amp;D expenditure on food product manufacturing has consistently increased by a margin greater than 5 per cent on a yearly basis. It was one of the few subdivisions within the manufacturing industry to increase as the advent of GFC set in from late-2007 to mid-2009.</p>
<p id="fig_3-13">Figure 3.13: R&amp;D Expenditure by Manufacturing Subdivision</p>

<p>Source: ABS 8104.0 <em>Research and Experimental Development, Businesses</em>, Australia<br /><a href="#des_44">Text description for R&amp;D Expenditure by Manufacturing Subdivision</a></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, given that the bulk of food processing businesses are located in Victoria, Queensland and NSW most of the R&amp;D expenditure increases in food product manufacturing between 2005-06 and 2009-10 occurred in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, and close to 89.6 per cent of total R&amp;D expenditure was in these states.</p>
<p>The business human resources devoted to R&amp;D on food product manufacturing in 2009-10 totalled 2104 person years of effort (PYE), an increase of 23.8 per cent from 2005-06 (refer to <strong><a href="#tbl_3-4">Table 3.4</a></strong>).</p>

<p>The meat and meat product manufacturing, dairy product manufacturing and bakery product manufacturing are the subdivisions within the food product manufacturing to have shown considerable increases in the amount of human resources devoted to R&amp;D, while sugar and confectionary manufacturing has fallen considerably and hit a significant low in 2008-09.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies R&amp;D activities according to the type of research effort, namely, pure basic research, strategic basic research, applied research and experimental development. A large proportion of the R&amp;D expenditure on food product manufacturing goes to experimental development, which involves using existing knowledge gained from research or practical experience that is directed to producing new materials, products, devices, policies, behaviours or outlooks; to installing new processes, systems and services; or to improving substantially those already produced or installed.</p>
<p>Food product manufacturing R&amp;D expenditure on experimental development has increased by approximately 35.1 per cent from 2005-06 to 2009-10 (refer to <strong><a href="#tbl_3-5">Table 3.5</a></strong>); however, the proportional movements of other categories during this period were much higher. According to the ABS report, pure basic research increased by 75.4 per cent, strategic basic research increased by 46.0 per cent and applied research increased by 49.0 per cent (albeit from relatively low absolute expenditure).</p>

<p>A significant amount of the R&amp;D expenditure in food product manufacturing industry is undertaken by the businesses themselves, i.e. the industry invested $421.2 million out of a total of $427.8 million in 2009-10 (<strong><a href="#tbl_3-6">Table 3.6</a></strong>). This includes all funding for R&amp;D sourced from the business itself, including: equity; borrowings; retained earnings; and non-R&amp;D specific transfers from related entities. More broadly, the R&amp;D expenditure across the whole of the food supply chain by the Australian Government totalled $715.0 million in 2008-09 (Productivity Commission 2011). This includes investment in rural R&amp;D corporations, CSIRO, Cooperative Research Centres and other avenues. In the same year, state and territory government rural R&amp;D investment was $416.0 million and private/industry investment was $364.0 million.<sup><a href="#fn_109" id="fnr_109">109</a></sup> CSIRO's specific investment in the processed food sector R&amp;D has focused on the following areas over the last three years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food safety</li>
<li>Novel processes (such as high pressure processing)</li>
<li>Technologies leading to new food ingredients such as microencapsulation and</li>
<li>Foods for health (such as new grain products e.g. BarleyMax).</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2009-10 CSIRO's R&amp;D investment in these areas totalled an estimated $17.6 million; for 2010-11 the estimated investment was $20.1 million; and for 2011-12 the figure was $23.5 million. <sup><a href="#fn_110" id="fnr_110">110</a></sup></p>

<p>The R&amp;D expenditure on food product manufacturing by businesses with 0-4 employees has decreased significantly by approximately 28.1 per cent while businesses with 5-19, 20-199 and 200 or more employees increased by 107.3 per cent, 55.9 per cent and 36.8 per cent respectively. Results from the PwC survey suggest that the surveyed large food processors' R&amp;D investment is about 1.0 to 1.3 per cent of sales, which is expected to continue. Smaller companies invest less than 0.5 per cent of sales on R&amp;D.

<p>CASE STUDY</p>
<p><strong>Devro in Bathurst</strong></p>
<p>Devro is a leading supplier of collagen casings for food, used by customers in the production of a wide variety of sausages and other meat products. It initially pioneered the development of edible collagen casing as part of Johnson &amp; Johnson. Through the assistance of the Regional Development Board and the Bathurst/Orange Development Corporation, it has been able to develop independently. Its R&amp;D is mostly done in-house with linkages to CSIRO in regards to hide processing to extract collagen and leather. The company has developed an innovative design for the scissoring and twisting equipment which has lowered its energy costs.</p>
</div>

<h5>Types of innovation</h5>
<p>The reasons given by processors for the high rate of new product introduction included:</p>
<ul>
<li>supermarkets' desire for innovation and diversity</li>
<li>high levels of competition and large food processors wanting to increase their market share of a declining branded product market</li>
<li>the need to renew core products and</li>
<li>the revenue from the lifecycle of a product is decreasing.</li>
</ul>
<p>For smaller companies, new product development is limited and tends to focus on niche or private labels, with a higher failure rate of branded products reported. A recent <em>Review of Victoria's Food Industry Requirements for Pilot Food Processing Plant and Product Innovation Services</em> commissioned by the Victorian Department of Primary Industry which surveyed a number of key food processors in that state (including several SMEs) concluded, inter alia, that: 'There has been a shift towards a defensive innovation strategy to "stay in business" with an emphasis on process and product innovation to reduce costs. This has come at the expense of product innovation to "grow the export market" and investment in break through innovation to "create options for future business growth".'<sup><a href="#fn_111" id="fnr_111">111</a></sup></p>
<p>The Australian food processing industry has the capacity to grow as the result of innovative solutions<sup><a href="#fn_112" id="fnr_112">112</a></sup> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborative partnerships - sharing of skill sets/new processes reducing costs and risks -'sharing means saving', particularly where government is one of the partners</li>
<li>Open innovation (enabling SMEs to collaborate with large firms)</li>
<li>Proactive skills development and 'knowledge infrastructure' in universities</li>
<li>ICT solutions in the 'paddock to plate' supply chain, such as bar codes, radio frequency identification devices and remote sensors</li>
<li>Niche marketing: organic foods, health-enhancing or functional foods, boutique products such as cheese, honey and beer</li>
<li>Increasing proximity of food processing facilities to agricultural inputs and final markets facilitated by a range of factors including improved transport logistics</li>
<li>Biotechnological applications to breeding and growing to improve productivity in agriculture</li>
<li>Innovative packaging and</li>
<li>Improvements in inventory management.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Biotechnology - gene technology</h5>
<p>Gene technology (one aspect of biotechnology) refers to techniques to alter/introduce new characteristics to organisms by modification of genes. Gene technology can be used to produce genetically modified organisms (GMOs). <sup><a href="#fn_113" id="fnr_113">113</a></sup> In Australia, the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) oversees the development and environmental release of GMOs under the <em>Gene Technology Act 2000</em>.</p>
<p>A bi-national government agency, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, is responsible for the regulation of all food products for retail sale, whether domestically produced or imported. GM foods are regulated under Standard 1.5.2 - Food produced using Gene Technology of the <em>Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code</em>. A GM food means a food which has been derived or developed from an organism which has been modified by gene technology. Standard 1.5.2 (an enforceable law) has two provisions - mandatory pre-market approval (based on a food safety assessment) and mandatory labeling requirements. New GM foods are assessed by a scientific comparison with the conventional counterpart food with a history of safe use. The safety assessment focuses on the properties of the new gene product(s), including potential allergenicity and toxicity, and examines any compositional differences in the food compared with the conventional form.</p>
<p>The benefits of genetically modified food/crops continue to be disputed domestically despite continued international growth. Of the 29 countries planting biotech crops in 2011, 19 were developing and 10 were industrialised countries. <sup><a href="#fn_114" id="fnr_114">114</a></sup> Five countries - the United States, Brazil, Argentina, India and Canada grow more than 90 per cent of the world's GM crops. Only two GM food crops, cotton and canola, are approved for cultivation in Australia. As well as these, various types of GM soybean, canola, corn and cotton produced overseas have been approved by FSANZ to enter the food market in Australia. As at June 2012, 56 GM foods are approved for use in Australia and New Zealand, and a further two applications are undergoing assessment.<sup><a href="#fn_115" id="fnr_115">115</a></sup></p>
<p>Studies within the agricultural sector (e.g. cotton industry) have demonstrated how first-generation issues of environmental stress (heat, salt, nutrient deficiency, pest and disease resistance) can improve with GM technology. In addition, GM technology has the potential to address supply and demand concerns, reduce costs, improve innovation and maintain sustainable industries.<sup><a href="#fn_116" id="fnr_116">116</a></sup></p>
<p>GM technology still faces negative commentary for a variety of reasons, encompassing broad social, environmental, philosophical or ethical views in the production of food. Sceptics argue that long-term impacts of GM technology cannot be measured effectively due to the relatively short period for which the technology has been implemented - i.e. 2011 marked the 16th year of the commercialisation of biotech crops<sup><a href="#fn_117" id="fnr_117">117</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, the 2010 European Commission report analysing EU-funded GMO research concluded that biotechnology and, in particular, GMOs were not per se more risky than conventional plant breeding techniques.<sup><a href="#fn_118" id="fnr_118">118</a></sup> This report was based on more than 130 research projects covering a period of more than 25 years of research and involving more than 500 independent research groups.</p>
<h5>Current mechanisms for engagement in public research</h5>
<p>Technological know-how is highly developed in Australian public and private sectors. It is critical that there are mechanisms for industry to drive public research. Our public research, especially in food and agriculture, is one of Australia's strengths (see <a href="#h2_11"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></a>).</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) has been instrumental in supporting the development of strategies for various food sectors, including the pork, seafood, dairy, sheep meat, poultry and sugarcane industries. CSIRO leads the Food and Nutrition Leaders Strategy that will add to these and report to the Primary Industries Ministerial Council (PIMC). The R&amp;D Strategy being developed by the Food and Nutrition Leaders will be available in late 2012.</p>
<p>The Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Program supports end-user driven research collaborations to address major challenges facing Australia, many of which are global challenges. Current and past food-related CRCs are listed in <a href="appendices.html#h3_35"><strong>Appendix A</strong></a>. There are no CRCs funded directly for the food processing sector.</p>
<p>The CSIRO has suggested that research efforts in the food processing sector in Australia have been historically concentrated on large national challenges and opportunities which have resulted in a well-focused, multi-disciplinary science approach. However, this has resulted in comparative neglect of many small and medium enterprises. To address this problem the CSIRO has established a SME Engagement Centre which focuses on a small number of very innovative SMEs who have the skills to adopt new technologies.</p>
<p>R&amp;D investment is intrinsic to improving productivity and profitability in existing industries and supporting the development of new, embryonic industries. The food manufacturing industry believes more must be done to encourage collaboration between the private and public sector, and through this report suggests a number of strategies to achieve this.</p>
<h4 id="h4_25">3.3.5 Packaging innovation</h4>
<p>In the 2011 PwC industry survey of 92 businesses, 48 thought that innovation in packaging would lead to significant gains in productivity and seven businesses said that it would lead to the biggest gain.</p>
<p>A number of submissions to the National Food Plan highlighted the importance of packaging to maintaining a sustainable food processing industry. Owens-Illinois, for example, stressed the importance of ensuring Australia's competitiveness across the food chain in order to reduce the increasing trend of importing fully packaged finished products, in part by considering the sustainability attributes of different packaging types that reduce environmental impact.</p>
<p>In the active packaging technology arena, chemical absorbers and emitters have been adopted in niche applications to preserve shelf-life and the quality of foods and beverages. This technology is used in the packaging of canned perishable food, such as canned fruits, beans and meat, among others. The development of absorbers and emitters that can be suitably integrated into packaging materials is expected to present a major opportunity for packagers worldwide.</p>
<p>Recently, low-permeability barrier materials have been developed and commercialised, and new polymers introduced for their barrier properties and heat resistance. Additives to plastic packaging provide UV resistance, improve biodegradability, and increase electrical or thermal conductivity. <sup><a href="#fn_119" id="fnr_119">119</a></sup></p>
<p>In food processing technology, notable advances have been made to aseptic and retort packaging, self-cooling technology, non-destructive quality control mechanisms for monitoring contamination and the bond strength of seals. Food, beverage and non-food categories are all likely to see further development in terms of packaging requirements in the near future.</p>
<p>Packaging technology such as time-temperature indicators (TTIs) are now widely used for a diverse array of commercial applications. The Coors Light cold-activated label is a good example of packaging that features a target temperature indicator. Thermal ink on the product's label changes from white to blue when the beer has been appropriately chilled. Biosensors are considered to be a promising area for future development and will be helpful in moving towards intelligent packaging. Biosensors measure biological activities, such as microbiological growth, and can indicate the freshness of food.<sup><a href="#fn_120" id="fnr_120">120</a></sup></p>
<p>Product packaging has also been used to improve sustainability. Coca-Cola's plant bottle is comprised of recyclable materials - 30 per cent plant-based sources and 70 per cent recycled plastic (PET polyethylene terephthalate). Plantic have commercialised an eco plastic which is of a multi-layer structure, predominately consisting of Plantic biopolymer which is certified as biodegradable and compostable (see case study overleaf).</p>
<div>
<p>CASE STUDY</p>
<p><strong>Plantic - An Australian Success Story</strong></p>
<p>Plantic Technologies was incorporated in Victoria in 2001 for the purposes of acquiring, developing and commercialising intellectual property developed by the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for International Food Manufacture and Packaging Science.</p>
<p>The CRC identified that a range of cornstarch-based formulations could be used to manufacture a flat sheet bioplastic, which then could be thermoformed to produce biodegradable trays. This discovery led to the lodgement of a provisional patent in 1999.</p>
<p>In 2002, Plantic was granted ownership of all the intellectual property by the CRC. By July 2003, Plantic had established supply to Cadbury Schweppes (Australia) and Kenman Kandy, a division of Mars/Masterfoods. The company officially launched its Plantic&reg; material and its presence to the packaging industry in August 2003 at the Auspack Trade Show in Melbourne, Australia and won two packaging awards for its Cadbury Milk chocolate box rigid tray.</p>
<p>In 2004, Plantic began operations in Europe, in close proximity to several leaders in the European food and confectionery industry. In 2005 Plantic Technologies Ltd commenced supply the European market with market leader clients such as M&amp;S and Nestl&eacute;. Since 2005 Plantic Technologies Ltd has established distribution agreements with global leaders and customised its technology to suit an ever-broader range of conversion techniques and applications, including thermoforming, injection moulding, film extrusion and blow moulding, as well as rigid and flexible packaging.</p>
<p>In 2009, a revolutionary bioplastic was developed that would change the nature of plastics globally. Plantic's eco plastic is a multi-layer structure, predominately consisting of Plantic biopolymer which is certified as biodegradable and compostable. The moisture protective skins are necessary as containment and a sealing layer for industry standard lidding technology. Future development of skins structures will enable a 100 per cent biopolymer construction.</p>
<p>Plantic has a packaging supply contract with Coles. In October 2011, Coles were awarded the Bronze Award for Sustainable Packaging by the Packaging Council of Australia for their Plantic ecoPlastic™ retail meat trays. In May 2012 Plantic reopened their manufacturing facilities following extensive upgrading to increase capacity by 400 per cent.</p>

<h3 id="h3_18">3.4 Regulatory Costs</h3>
<h4 id="h4_26">3.4.1 Regulatory environment</h4>
<p>The Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation System is a bi-national arrangement involving the Australian Government, State and Territory Governments and the New Zealand Government. In Australia, food regulation involves all three levels of government.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of the system is the separation of policy decision making from the development of standards. Policy is agreed by the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation (FoFR) and is then referred to by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) to develop food standards for the <em>Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Code</em>.</p>
<p>FSANZ is an independent statutory authority established under the <em>Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991</em>.</p>
<p>The food regulation system is underpinned by the following instruments and governance structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Food Regulation Agreement (FRA), an Intergovernmental agreement with the State and Territories committing to a national system of food regulation</li>
<li>the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand Concerning a Joint Food Standards System</li>
<li>the FoFR, a forum made up of Australian, State, Territory and New Zealand Ministers with responsibility for food. The FoFR is chaired by the Australian Government Parliamentary Secretary. The FoFR is responsible for developing food regulation policy guidelines for domestic food standards, and for promoting a consistent approach to compliance with, and the enforcement of food standards. The FoFR can also amend or reject food standards and request that these be reviewed</li>
<li>the Food Regulation Standing Committee (FRSC), a high-level officials group which develops policy advice, as well as providing advice on the best ways to involve stakeholders in policy development and</li>
<li>the Implementation Sub Committee (ISC), a senior government officials group, which facilitates consistent implementation and enforcement of food regulations and standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Australia is held in high regard worldwide for its safe and clean food supply, and the system in place is certainly critical in the maintenance of that reputation. However, there are still a number of issues associated with the application of Australian food standards and related regulation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>differences in food safety regulations and enforcement between the States and Territories</li>
<li>the ability of New Zealand to choose to vary or opt out of some standards</li>
<li>biosecurity fees</li>
<li>costs and time delays in changes to the Food Standards Code. Industry has advised that applications may cost between $50 000 and $250 000, and take many months to be approved. An unpaid application may take a further 6-9 months; and</li>
<li>the Model Food Provisions contained in Annex A and Annex B, gives effect to a commitment by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to a national approach to food regulation in Australia. However, to date there is still some inconsistency between the food acts in each jurisdiction. A 2007 AFGC study<sup><a href="#fn_121" id="fnr_121">121</a></sup> comparing State and Territory food Acts to the Model Food Bill found major variations, with jurisdictional legislation and differing levels of prioritisation, resourcing and enforcement of food safety. The different mandatory food safety requirements and degrees of enforcement in each jurisdiction cause large unnecessary costs for food manufacturers operating in multiple jurisdictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two major national retailers (Coles Group and Woolworths) raised concerns about inconsistencies across jurisdictions in training competency requirements for staff working with and selling liquor. For example, each jurisdiction had different requirements for Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) training and, with the exception of Western Australia, will not recognise RSA training that is completed in another jurisdiction. This imposes a barrier to the transferability of staff between stores in different states since staff must be retrained to work in another jurisdiction. The AFGC claimed that the development of separate food hygiene regulations by individual states and territories had resulted in differing application of those rules.</p>
<p>In 2008 the Productivity Commission Report on Regulatory Burdens on Businesses in the Manufacturing and Distributive Trades<sup><a href="#fn_122" id="fnr_122">122</a></sup> recommended that the Model Food Bill (now the FRA) be implemented consistently across all jurisdictions unless there was demonstrable need for local or regional requirements, and that enforcement of the regulations be the responsibility of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Applications by industry to amend the food safety standards can constitute large direct costs to manufacturers (typically over $100 000), and further indirect costs of opportunities lost (including inability to compete with imports not subject to the same standards) due to delays of several years in application processing. Such applications must be submitted to FSANZ for consideration, before assessment or potentially subsequent requests for reviews by the FoFR. A number of applications have taken excessive lengths of time to reach a resolution.</p>
<p>For example, the AFGC claimed that the application process by Australian Beverages Council to enable domestic manufacturers to produce vitamin-fortified beverages was estimated to have caused an opportunity cost of $350 million and took four years to complete.<sup><a href="#fn_123" id="fnr_123">123</a></sup> Similarly, it took four years to approve calcium fortification of juices and biscuits.<sup><a href="#fn_124" id="fnr_124">124</a></sup> Such costs are likely to be prohibitively large for many MNEs; much more for SMEs.</p>
<p>The Productivity Commission Report also recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>amendment of the FSANZ Act to improve the timeliness of the development and amendment of food standards</li>
<li>amendments to ensure new food standard proposals include a full regulation impact statement demonstrating the cost-benefits of the proposal and</li>
<li>changes to the FRA to improve the transparency of the FoFR decision-making process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The National Partnership to Deliver a Seamless National Economy specified the National Partnership Implementation Plan. In reference to this plan, in December 2010, the COAG Reform Council identified that in relation to food regulatory reforms, that the following reforms had been completed:</p>
<ul>
<li>All jurisdictions through FoFR (then known as the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council) to undertake a comprehensive review of food labelling law and policy, with a progress report to COAG by July 2009.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth to provide a report to COAG, by May 2010 on progress in redrafting the Food Regulation Agreement reflecting revised FoFR voting arrangements.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth to provide a report to COAG, by May 2010 on progress in drafting the intergovernmental agreement confirming the Australian Government and the State and Territory Governments commitment to establish a centralised interpretive advisory service.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also a number of recognised food safety management systems - primarily based on the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles - under which food manufacturers must be certified to do business. Manufacturers can be certified by a HACCP auditor; however, most manufacturers supplying to multiple retailers will choose certification against one of the standards below, and often have additional certification requirements imposed by the retailers. Manufacturers must fulfil and pay for these mandatory certification requirements of their retailers, in addition to any other retailer specific certification requirements imposed by the retailer to differentiate their quality. Examples of international food safety standards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>British Retail Consortium (BRC) Global Standard for Food Safety
<ul>
<li>Grade A and B: audited every 12 months</li>
<li>Grade C: audited every six months</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ISO 22000 Food Safety Management System Standard</li>
<li>SQF 2000 Code<sup><a href="#fn_127" id="fnr_127">127</a></sup></li>
<li>AS/NZS ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System Standard
<ul>
<li>Overlaps with approximately half of the BRC, but has a significant number of unique additional requirements</li>
<li>Applicable to a range of industries (including food, hospitality, utilities, resources, construction, agriculture, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some high-risk food sectors, such as water, meat, seafood, eggs and organic foods, have specific certification requirements.</p>
<p>Food manufacturers supplying branded and private label products for the major supermarket and retail food service providers have a mandatory requirement to comply with the retailers' QA programs. These requirements are different to the certification required under jurisdictional law, but involve substantial duplication, and require additional periodic audits (typically 6-12 months apart) imposing a significant cost overhead (approximately $1000-2000 for each Woolworths Quality Assurance standard audit<sup><a href="#fn_128" id="fnr_128">128</a></sup>). Consultation with manufacturers has indicated that large manufacturers may face up to 50 QA audits per year, causing direct costs of over $100 000 and imposing indirect costs several times higher.</p>
<p>Some of the QA programs of the major grocery and food service retailers are listed below:</p>
<ul>

<p>The value of QA audits is not disputed as they ensure that Australia's reputation as a clean, safe food producer is maintained. However, the information sought by the separate audits required by each jurisdictions and major retailers, and which are undertaken across various standards are duplicative, amounting to substantial and potentially unnecessary increased direct and indirect costs, and ambiguity in regulatory requirements. This was acknowledged by Woolworths when it gave evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Australia's Food Processing Sector.<sup><a href="#fn_136" id="fnr_136">136</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="h4_27">3.4.2 Trade and tariffs</h4>
<p>Australia's agriculture and food sectors are heavily dependent on exports, and hence have a major stake in the maintenance of an open world trading system. Australia provides competitive agricultural and food produce to world markets without the high levels of financial support, protection and other trade-distorting practices used by many other countries to prop up these sectors. An enthusiastic participant in World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations, Australia has sought to promote policies that encourage trade liberalisation and create a more open market for agriculture and food businesses.</p>
<p>Internationally, agriculture and food traders, including Australian traders, are severely disadvantaged by trade distortion. The three main types of support distort measures are market access barriers, domestic subsidies and export subsidies. These measures are intended to subsidise the producer's income in the country imposing them, and they impact adversely on international production and trade-flow decisions.</p>
<p>Australia has led by example, through reforms which saw it reduce its tariffs on agricultural and food products in the early 1970s. These reforms have led to productivity growth in the agriculture and food sector and to benefits to the consumer.</p>
<p>A sustained and concerted effort is required through multilateral, bilateral and regional trade negotiations and agreements to tackle the barriers to trade. Raising tariff barriers works in exactly the opposite direction to what is needed. Lowering trade barriers encourages international trade and stimulate demand, and in so doing reduce the impacts of a financial crisis elsewhere<sup><a href="#fn_137" id="fnr_137">137</a></sup>.</p>
<h4 id="h3_19">3.4.3 Quarantine</h4>
<p>Australia's quarantine policy is crucial to ensuring the protection of human, animal and plant health. To safeguard against exotic pests and diseases, Australia has adopted a stringent approach to imported agricultural products. Having such measures help protects our agricultural industries and protects or exports. These conservative quarantine settings have been justified by a series of disease outbreaks over the recent years, including the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or 'mad cow' disease), foot and mouth disease and avian influenza (bird flu). However, in the eyes of some members of the World Trade Organization, Australia's strict quarantine requirements are seen as a 'technical trade barrier' used to keep out foreign competitors. DFAT is working with WTO members to counter any misunderstandings they may have about our quarantine process.</p>
<p>There are benefits to having a disease-free status as unexpected export opportunities can be realised as was the case in the lucrative beef market. In 2003, United States reported a single case of BSE. This discovery had a profound impact on beef trade patterns in the Asia-Pacific, especially in Japan where the demand for and value of Australian beef increased substantially.</p>
<p>DAFF Biosecurity is in charge of controlling Australia's quarantine regulations which are designed to prevent the introduction, establishment and spread of human, animal and plant pests and diseases. A vast majority of the agricultural and food produce exported from Australia is inspected by DAFF Biosecurity. The costs associated with these inspection services, which are rigorous, have undergone considerable change over the last few years.</p>
<p>In November 2001 the Government introduced a 40 per cent contribution toward the costs of DAFF Biosecurity Export activities, whereby the DAFF Biosecurity Export Programs operated under a 60 per cent cost-recovery arrangement, with the remaining 40 per cent of costs met by the Government contribution. This funding lapsed on 30 June 2009 and required that fees and charges for DAFF Biosecurity Export Programs return to a 100 per cent cost-recovery arrangement. Since that time the costs in the program have increased and it is causing considerable aggravation to processors and exporters who are blaming it for affecting their ability to compete in the international market.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, the Government provided $127.4 million for the Export Certification Reform Package project. This project developed revised service delivery arrangements for the export sectors to reduce regulatory costs and introduced efficiencies into the export process to generally reduce costs for exporters.</p>
<p>If we observe the DAFF biosecurity costs associated with the Meat Export Program (refer to <strong><a href="#tbl_3-8">Table 3.8</a></strong>), these clearly indicates that inspection service costs have increased significantly over the last few years. DAFF biosecurity export inspection costs have been discussed by the Export Meat Industry Advisory Committee (EMIAC) which is chaired and run by DAFF biosecurity with representation from all major export industry bodies.</p>
<p>One of the main issues with the inspection service fees is that they appear to have grown rapidly, creating an excessive burden on small businesses, cutting their margins and putting them in a precarious position. In addition, industry does not believe that it is consulted sufficiently. A stringent quarantine regulation regime is necessary to compete in the export market; however, a more through consultation process is required with regards to fee structure, which should take into account smaller players in the market.</p>

<h4 id="h4_28">3.4.4 Taxation</h4>
<p>In 2010, the final report of the Australia's Future Tax System Review (the Henry Tax Review) was released. The Review examined Australian and state government taxes. Some of the recommendations of the Review were welcomed by industry and business groups, including a reduction in the company income tax rate and new small business asset write-off and depreciation rules.</p>
<p>The Government's response to the Review's recommendations supported a number of recommendations in principle. Some of the initiatives that will benefit business include:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the 2012-13 income year small businesses will be able to write off the full value of eligible business assets in the year of purchase (including motor vehicles costing less than $6500). Small businesses will be able to depreciate other assets (other than buildings) in a single general small business pool - saving money and paperwork.</li>
<li>Small businesses will be able to depreciate assets costing more than $6500 (other than buildings) in a single depreciation pool at a rate of 30 per cent (15 per cent in the first year). The simplified depreciation pooling arrangements will also allow small businesses to depreciate some longer-life assets more quickly (at a rate of 30 per cent instead of 5 per cent), and will help to reduce compliance costs.</li>
<li>A one year loss carry-back will apply in 2012-13 where tax losses incurred in that year can be carried back and offset against tax paid in 2011-12. For 2013-14 and later years, tax losses can be carried back and offset against tax paid up to two years earlier. Companies will be able to carry back $1 million of losses each year. This will provide a cash benefit of up to $300 000 a year. Ninety per cent of the companies to benefit from this new tax measure are expected to be small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many stakeholders in the food processing industry identify state payroll taxes as being a major disincentive to investment and to employing more people, and to be of most burden to labour-intensive industries and businesses.<sup><a href="#fn_138" id="fnr_138">138</a></sup> Unlike a reduction in the company tax rate, abolishing payroll tax would benefit employers based on turnover rather than whether their business is incorporated or not.</p>
<p>Similarly, in its Budget 2012-13 Submission to Treasury, the Australian Food and Grocery Council called on Government to introduce accelerated depreciation provisions for food and grocery manufacturers to purchase new plant and equipment to improve productivity and energy efficiency and also encourage investment during this period of high exchange rates. The Industry members of the Strategy Group support this request.</p>
<p>A previous reduction in the company tax rate to 30 per cent (effective from 2001-02) was largely funded by the removal of accelerated depreciation and basing depreciation write-offs on assets' effective lives. The effective life reviews follow the recommendations of the Ralph Review of business taxation to ensure that the revised depreciation schedule is as accurate, representative and comprehensive as possible.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has made a cut in the company tax rate a key priority for Labor coming out of a Federal Government economic forum on Wednesday 13 June 2012.<sup><a href="#fn_139" id="fnr_139">139</a></sup> The Strategy Group supports this commitment.</p>
<h3 id="h3_20">3.5 Other Overhead Activities</h3>
<h4 id="h4_29">3.5.1 Marketing</h4>
<p>Advertising expenditure for the supermarket sector in the period Oct 2010-Sept 2011 was $204.2 million, a growth of 3 per cent over the previous financial year, despite tightening consumer spending.<sup><a href="#fn_140" id="fnr_140">140</a></sup> Market exposure to private label (retailer brands) and price discounting campaigns have served to improve the consumer mindset of perceived private label quality against branded products. Food retailer Coles, in an attempt to develop product differentiation themes, has introduced 'No Added Hormones Beef' to its product range in January 2011.</p>
<p>This tactical marketing shift has been influenced by the consumer pursuit for balance, health and wellbeing, with increased prominence for the organics sector. Marketing campaigns have increased focus on produce that is natural, chemical-free, free from additives, preservatives and environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p>For 39 of 92 respondents in the 2011 PwC survey, marketing was their focus area for innovation improvements. In addition, marketing was listed along with sales, innovation and processes as being critical areas to improve business competitiveness.</p>
<p>Large businesses tend to conduct market research and consumer insights to a greater extent than small businesses which tend to lack the capacity or capability. Those that do it well, manage to reduce the number of new product failures. Respondents in the 2011 PwC survey were asked if their businesses undertook market research or consumer insight surveys as a means to improve competitiveness. Of the 92 respondents, 52 businesses had undertaken some form of market research, 39 had not and one was unsure.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier in the chapter, the respondents to the PwC survey stated lack of market demand as the biggest inhibitor of sales. When asked what proportion of costs their business spent on areas incorporating HR, finance and marketing activities, three businesses spent 0 per cent, 33 businesses allocated 1-5 per cent of costs, 24 businesses allocated 6-10 per cent of costs, five business allocated 11-20 per cent of costs, four businesses spent greater than 20 per cent of costs, 9 businesses were unsure and 10 businesses had no comment.</p>
<h4 id="h4_30">3.5.2 Advertising</h4>
<p>Food category advertising in the 12 months to September 2011 slumped 14 per cent by share of estimated main media spend.<sup><a href="#fn_141" id="fnr_141">141</a></sup> Of the 10 sectors with the highest advertising spends; only two, snack food and meat, recorded growth. Advertising by the supermarket and retail sector had moderate growth with supermarkets accounting for $204.2 million, representing 86 per cent of all media spending.<sup><a href="#fn_142" id="fnr_142">142</a></sup> Research suggests that supermarket catalogues influence consumer spending habits (only 15 per cent are disposed by consumers) and have the potential to lift incremental sales by approximately 20-25 per cent.<sup><a href="#fn_143" id="fnr_143">143</a></sup> Research has also found that Australian consumers equate advertising with unnecessary price premiums. Sixty-seven per cent of consumers are under the belief that well-known brands are more expensive than private labels due to the extra spend on advertising.<sup><a href="#fn_144" id="fnr_144">144</a></sup> The overall retail advertising sector remained overall in good shape in 2011 finishing just down year-on-year.<sup><a href="#fn_145" id="fnr_145">145</a></sup></p>
<p>From a regulatory standpoint, food advertising has been subject to much public debate given the trends in childhood obesity. Under the <em>Broadcasting Services Act</em> and Code of Practice (section 123), advertisements directed to children for food and beverages should not encourage or promote an inactive lifestyle; should not encourage or promote unhealthy eating or drinking habits; and must not contain any misleading or incorrect information about the nutritional value of the product (clause 6.23).</p>
<p>While food advertising to children will not be discussed in this report in great detail, it is estimated that restricting unhealthy food advertising between the hours of 7:00am and 8:30pm could reduce children's exposure to unhealthy food advertising by as much as 79.2 per cent.<sup><a href="#fn_146" id="fnr_146">146</a></sup></p>
<p>Confectionary company Cadbury has found a novel way to educate the consumer and encourage them to 'enjoy treats as part of a balanced lifestyle.' The 'Be Treatwise' logo and campaign on Cadbury packaging encourages consumers to 'get to know the percentage Daily Intakes (% DIs) to assist in decision making for a balanced diet.<sup><a href="#fn_147" id="fnr_147">147</a></sup></p>
<p>Food companies advertising products which are considered as 'healthy alternatives' have embraced the use of well-known logos such as the National Heart Foundation 'Tick of Approval' or the Glycemic Index Foundation 'GI symbol program' in their marketing campaigns. Print and media advertisements for these products often focus on healthy lifestyle pursuits and include some form of celebrity endorsement.</p>

<h4 id="h4_31">3.5.3 Branding</h4>
<p>Branding normally through trade-marking is a valuable asset for business to drive demand, secure business partners and reassure financial markets. In the 2012 Brand Finance report which analysed Australia's top 30 most valuable brands, supermarket retailer Woolworths maintained the rank of Australia's most valuable brand - a position held since 2009<sup><a href="#fn_148" id="fnr_148">148</a></sup>. On the flipside, the supermarket retailer also experienced the biggest absolute loss of brand value - $504m in the 2011-12 financial year. This shift resulted largely from improvements made by competitor Coles in terms of price, efficiency, in-store design and marketing communications. In the 2011-12 financial year Coles improved its absolute value by 14 per cent and was ranked as the third-most valuable brand in Australia.</p>
<p>For the grocery food sector, branding is seen as a process of creating distinctive and durable perceptions in the mind of consumers. Strong brands, such as Kraft, Cadbury, Kellogg's, Uncle Tobys, Sanitarium, Coca-Cola and Arnotts, for example, build customer loyalty by marketing an image of quality - i.e. positive product associations based on past user experience (reliability). Clever and effective use of advertising coupled with strong product names/images/logos can not only increase market awareness but also increase market share. According to the 2011 Nielson Special Report which examined <em>Marketing to Grocery Buyers</em>; combining the power and mass reach of TV and food magazines is a potent mix for fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) brands to target the grocery buyer. The top 20 advertisers in the FMCG space each spent between $4-$12 million on media in the first half of 2011.<sup><a href="#fn_149" id="fnr_149">149</a></sup> Of these advertisers, the top three (Kellogg's (Aust), Nestl&eacute; Australia (Ltd) and Unilever Australia) spent a combined total of $29.9m.</p>
<h5>The Australian Brand</h5>
<p>Retailers and associations including the AFGC have launched marketing campaigns to strengthen and support the purchase of 'Australian Made' products. In the 2011 PwC survey, food processing industry respondents noted that using the 'Australian made, Australian grown' label provided them with a greater competitive edge, yet they were often restricted in using these products due to the cost of Australian raw materials.</p>
<p>The Australian Made logo certification trade mark was created by the Australian Government in 1986 to promote Australian-made products in local and export markets and to assist consumers identify Australian products. It is estimated that 94 per cent of Australian consumers recognise the triangular logo encasing a stylised kangaroo.<sup><a href="#fn_150" id="fnr_150">150</a></sup> The Australian Made, Australian Grown (AMAG) logo (managed now by the Australian Made Campaign Limited (AMCL)), when included on product packaging, may be used with claims of Australian origin, including: 'Product of Australia,' and 'Australian Made.'</p>
<p>The 212 food businesses which use the AMAG logo range in size from big retailers to tiny niche manufacturers or growers. The minimum licence fee is $300 (plus GST), based on a turnover of goods less than $300 000 per annum. For sales of eligible goods up to $20 million the fee is 0.1 per cent of sales, up to $45 million is 0.02 per cent of sales and over $45 million is a flat fee of $25 000 plus GST. The AMAG logo is one of several marketed as a means of promoting products of Australian origin.</p>
<p>According to an August 2009 report by Roy Morgan Research commissioned by Australian Made Campaign Limited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eighty-one per cent of Australians would prefer to buy Australian-made or grown food and beverages, which is greater than other types of products (range from 44 to 60 per cent)</li>
<li>The likelihood of consumers buying Australian-made or grown products increases with their age. More than 50 per cent of consumers over the age of 35 are conscious of purchasing Australian-made or grown products</li>
<li>It becomes more difficult for people over the age of 50 to identify that a particular product is Australian made or grown.</li>
<li>Eighty-five per cent of consumers have confidence that the Australian Made logo to is an accurate indicator of origin compared, to 50 per cent of consumers for the terms 'made in Australia' or 'Australian-made' appearing without the logo</li>
<li>A lower price can persuade 53 per cent of consumers to buy imports over Australian-made products, although this influence tends to decrease with age, especially once a consumer is over 50</li>
</ul>
<h6>Product of Australia</h6>
<p>'Product of Country' is a premium claim defined in the Australian Consumer Law [part of the <em>Competition and Consumer Act 2010</em> (CCA)] and adopted by the Food Standards Code. To qualify for the protection afforded to a 'Product of Australia' claim, and each significant ingredient must be derived from Australia and all or virtually all of the production or manufacturing processes must be carried out in Australia.<sup><a href="#fn_151" id="fnr_151">151</a></sup></p>
<h6>Made in Australia</h6>
<p>For goods labelled as 'Made in Australia', as defined in the CCA, the product must have been substantially transformed in Australia and 50 per cent or more of the cost of producing or manufacturing the goods must take place in Australia.<sup><a href="#fn_152" id="fnr_152">152</a></sup> While the latter part of that requirement is measurable, the former is less clear. ACCC guidelines only provide two extreme examples - one that reconstituting fruit juice does not involve substantial transformation of the fruit juice and another producing a cake from a variety of ingredients does involve the substantial transformation of those ingredients. This information is not necessarily sufficient for many manufacturers to make a claim with confidence.</p>
<p>Many Australian food producers and their customers are confused about the current rules for making country of origin claims, particularly in relation to the representation 'Made in (country)', and the interpretation of 'substantial transformation'. More guidance is needed on what is substantial transformation. For example, the definition of substantial transformation under the AMAG logo appears better articulated and arguably more restrictive than under the ACCC guidelines. For instance, the AMCL states that canning, preserving, blending, marinating and coating are not considered to be substantial transformation.</p>
<p>While the food industry believes more must be done to educate consumers on Country of Origin Labelling (CoOL) claims, the first step should be to determine an appropriate definition of substantial transformation for food products that ensures 'Made in (country)' claims in relation to food are not misleading to the average Australian consumer.</p>
<p>In response to recommendation 42 of the Labelling Logic: Review of Food Labelling Law and Policy report, and, in recognition of the confusion with terminology, the Council of Australian Governments' Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation will request relevant consumer protection agencies to review existing CoOL materials (including publications, guidelines and other educational material) in a consultative process and, if appropriate, develop an education campaign with the specific objective of clarifying CoOL.</p>
<p>There are claims that Australia's country of origin labelling framework allows food imported into New Zealand to be repacked and labelled "product of" or "made in" New Zealand before being exported to Australia. <sup><a href="#fn_153" id="fnr_153">153</a></sup> This claim is based on the exemption of New Zealand imports from the country of origin labelling provisions of the Food Standards Code and the Competition and Consumer Act 1910 (CCA) due to the operation of the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Act 1997 (TTMRA). This has led to calls for tougher country of origin labelling laws.</p>
<p>Under Australia's current country of origin labelling framework, food could not be imported into or sold in Australia if it is labelled "product of" or made in" New Zealand unless such a statements are true and not misleading. The TTMRA exempts New Zealand imports from the application of the Food Standards Code and the CCA only if they could legally be sold in New Zealand. New Zealand's laws do not allow the sale of goods with false or misleading country of origin representations. Representations that food imported into and merely repackaged in New Zealand is "product of" or "made in" New Zealand would be considered false or misleading. Therefore, such goods could not be lawfully sold in New Zealand, and would not be exempt from the Food Standards Code or the CCA if imported into Australia.</p>
<p>Also, all goods imported into Australia, including from New Zealand, must comply with the Commerce Trade Descriptions Act 1905 (CTDA), which is specifically excluded from the operation of the TTMRA. Regulations made for the purposes of the CTDA require all food and beverage articles imported into Australia (including from New Zealand) to be marked with the country in which they were made or produced, and the CTDA prohibits the importation of goods bearing a false trade description.</p>
<h5>Further regulation</h5>
<p>In April 2012, a proposal to extend mandatory Country of Origin Labelling (CoOL) to unpackaged beef, sheep and chicken meats was approved by FSANZ.<sup><a href="#fn_154" id="fnr_154">154</a></sup> Subsequently, in June 2012, the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation (FoFR) requested FSANZ to review this proposal by 20 September 2012. Finalisation of this proposed amendment to the Food Standards Code is subject to this review and FoFR's agreement.</p>
<p>While CoOL can be shown to be necessary to address fully articulated 'market failure', reservations have been placed on mandatory origin labelling for 'consumer value' reasons. Consideration must be given to any potential costs to industry resulting from regulatory burden. That being said, there is value in industry-initiated self-regulatory intervention to allow for a more structured approach to consumer value issues.</p>
<h3 id="h3_21">3.6 The Retail Sector</h3>
<h4 id="h4_32">3.6.1 Structure</h4>
<p>Australia's food retail supermarket landscape consists of two major players, Woolworths Ltd and Westfarmers Ltd (Coles) who account for 71 per cent market share.<sup><a href="#fn_155" id="fnr_155">155</a></sup> The remaining 29 per cent is split between Independent Grocers of Australia (IGA) (7 per cent), Aldi (4 per cent), Australian United Retailers (trading as Foodworks) (2.3 per cent), Franklins (&lt;1 per cent) and SPAR (&lt;1 per cent).<sup><a href="#fn_156" id="fnr_156">156</a></sup></p>
<p>Coles and Woolworths are not only large by Australian standards but are reaching world scale in their operations, ranked 21 and 18 respectively in Deloitte's 2012 Global Powers of Retailing Report.<sup><a href="#fn_157" id="fnr_157">157</a></sup></p>
<p>Wholesale food distribution within the Australian market is dominated by Metcash Limited which specialises in divisions of grocery and fresh produce (IGA Distribution), liquor (Australian Liquor Marketers), hardware (Mitre 10) and other fast-moving consumer goods (Campbells Wholesale). All divisions are fully owned by Metcash with the exception of Mitre 10, of which it owns 50.1 per cent.<sup><a href="#fn_158" id="fnr_158">158</a></sup> Metcash also has control of the Franklins supermarket chain resulting from its July 2010 acquisition of 85 supermarket (77 corporate, eight franchised) stores.<sup><a href="#fn_159" id="fnr_159">159</a></sup></p>

<p>In a report titled <em>Exploring Treasure Island</em> (2012), UBS Securities Australia Ltd states that the collective market share of the top three retailers in the Australian retail market is significantly greater than of the top three retailers in the United States of America. In addition, the report suggests that the market concentration in Australia presents pressure on stakeholders, diminishing the bargaining power of suppliers, logistics, and landlords (<strong><a href="#fig_3-15">Figure 3.15</a></strong>).</p>
<p id="fig_3-15">Figure 3.15: Retail Market Concentration</p>

<p>Source: UBS Securities Australia Ltd, 2012, <em>Exploring Treasure Island</em> - Mach II, p.8<br /><a href="#des_46">Text description for Retail Market Concentration</a></p>
<p>After New Zealand, Australia has the highest concentration of retail grocery power in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.<sup><a href="#fn_160" id="fnr_160">160</a></sup> This has an impact on some manufacturers' margins and their R&amp;D spend and ambitions (see <a href="#h4_34">3.6.3</a>). 'Buyer power may suppress investment by suppliers in process and product innovation as well as in maintenance and upkeep if it reduces suppliers' expected returns from such investment. Consumers are harmed by a lower rate of innovation and product quality. If the exercise of buyer power results in fewer new products coming to market, a reduced variety of products and/or a reduction in product quality, consumer welfare could be harmed. This is likely to hinge on the existing profitability of suppliers: the more profitable they are, the less likely that such effects will materialise. However, if suppliers are currently struggling to earn sufficient profits to permit them to make the necessary investments or even stay in business, then increased buyer power could have these detrimental welfare effects.'<sup><a href="#fn_161" id="fnr_161">161</a></sup></p>
<p>The Australian food and grocery retail sector appears to correspond most closely to an oligopsonistic economic model, i.e. a small number of buyers and many sellers.<sup><a href="#fn_162" id="fnr_162">162</a></sup> Coles, Woolworths, and at a wholesale level, Metcash, have substantial market power, ostensibly as the consequence of organic growth and merger and acquisitions over time. Oligopsonistic market conditions are a form of imperfect competition, where the buyer has some degree of power (depending on the elasticity of supply and the number of buyers in the market) in setting prices below the price that would prevail in a perfectly competitive market. The extent to which retailers are able to leverage their buyer power in negotiations regarding pricing and trading terms depends largely on the alternative options available to the supplier to sell its products as well as the strength of the supplier's brand in terms of providing countervailing bargaining power in negotiations. Typically, few suppliers of processed foods have alternative options available as the grocery distribution channel is the major route to consumers, and few suppliers have strong countervailing bargaining power across their entire product range. As a result, the major grocery retailers are able to purchase products - and other services across the supply chain, such as transport and packaging - on better trading terms than other buyers.</p>
<p>A recent report by the British Institute of International and Comparative Law has confirmed that the issue of unfair commercial practices and unequal bargaining power between retailers and suppliers in the food supply chain is an area of concern for a large number of Member States in the EU.<sup><a href="#fn_163" id="fnr_163">163</a></sup> 'At present, no Member State employs a single method of enforcement that is fully effective. This is, to a large extent, because the majority of mechanisms are based on competition law, but also because it is difficult to create a model that adequately takes into account the unique nature of the food retailer/supplier relationship'.<sup><a href="#fn_164" id="fnr_164">164</a></sup></p>
<p>The researchers concluded that a mix of hard law and soft law solutions may be the most effective. The concept of unfair practices in business-to-business trading relations could be achieved by converting the standards or code into a statutory requirement and/or applying competition law in a way that creates precedents for behaviour by retailers on which suppliers are dependent. 'This might include pursuing dominance cases, where unfair practices are imposed by a retailer which has market power over suppliers through, for example, controlling access to its shelves which in turn are the only conduit to a cohort of consumers who cannot be accessed by suppliers in any other way'<sup><a href="#fn_165" id="fnr_165">165</a></sup>. In addition, the report suggests structural remedies could extend to restricting vertical integration of wholesaling by retailers, when they adversely affect the ability of suppliers to reach a range of retailers and the ability of smaller retailers to obtain grocery products at competitive prices from a range of competing wholesalers.</p>
<p>On 21 June, 2012 the Norwegian Government, through its ministers responsible for consumer affairs, competition, food and agriculture, announced that it will establish a committee of legal experts to elaborate a legal solution to securing good business practices by companies, as well as consumer interests, in the food and groceries market. Consumer interests are to be given a broad definition, comprising price, range of choice, quality and availability. Enforcement of the law will be considered as an integral part of the work. The precise mandate and composition of the legal committee is yet to be established but work will commence in the autumn of 2012.</p>
<p>Some Strategy Group members noted that there is an upside to fewer retailers. Distribution affects profits and competitiveness since it can contribute up to 50 per cent of the final selling price of some goods. This affects cost competitiveness as well as profits since margins are squeezed by distribution costs. Some producers prefer fewer distribution channels as it makes sales and marketing easier; however, none of the businesses in the PwC industry survey said this was an advantage.</p>

<p>The regulation of planning and zoning is primarily the responsibility of the States and Territories.</p>
<p>The 2008 Report of the ACCC inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for standard groceries (ACCC Grocery Inquiry Report) and the Productivity Commission's 2008 Market for Retail Tenancy Leases in Australia inquiry report each made similar recommendations on planning and zoning laws restricting competition in the supply and use of retail space. The key finding of the ACCC's Grocery Inquiry Report was that while grocery retailing is 'workably competitive', there are a number of factors that limit the level of price competition, including 'the complexities of planning applications...[which] provide the opportunity for Coles and Woolworths to "game" the planning system to delay or prevent potential competitors entering local areas'.</p>
<p>The ACCC considered that the appropriate policy response was to attempt to lower barriers to entry and expansion, in both retailing and wholesaling, of independent supermarkets and potential new entrants. On 5 August 2008 the Government released its Preliminary Action Plan in response to the ACCC Grocery Inquiry Report and referred the potentially anti-competitive impacts of state and local planning and zoning laws to COAG.</p>
<p>On 29 November 2008 COAG agreed to examine further planning and zoning from a competition perspective as recommended in the ACCC Grocery Inquiry Report. At the COAG meeting of 7 December 2009 it was agreed that planning laws should not unjustifiably restrict competition in grocery retailing. It was also agreed that the Productivity Commission would report on the States' and Territories' planning and zoning systems to identify practices that support or unjustifiably restrict competition.</p>
<p>In April 2010 the Government requested that the Productivity Commission examine and report on the states' and territories' planning and zoning systems, particularly as they impact on business compliance costs; competition; and the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the functioning of cities. The Commission was also asked to report on best-practice approaches that support competition.</p>
<p>On 16 May 2011 the Productivity Commission's final report, <em>Performance Benchmarking of Australian Business Regulation: Planning, Zoning and Development Assessments</em>, was released. The report found that some restrictions on competition may be required to improve the overall efficiency of urban land allocation and use. However, it identified a number of constraints imposed by planning and zoning systems that unjustifiably restrict entry into markets and reduce the flexibility of businesses operating in a particular zone or centre.</p>
<p>The Productivity Commission identified a range of processes from various jurisdictions which it considers to be leading practice, and which it advocated that states and territories should implement. The Productivity Commission reiterated many of the abovementioned recommendations in relation to planning and zoning in its November 2011 inquiry report into the Economic Structure and Performance of the Australian Retail Industry.</p>
<p>In its December 2011 response to the report, the Government encouraged State and Territory governments to carefully consider and implement where appropriate the findings of the Commission's report and its previous benchmarking report; particularly, the scope to give greater weight to economic considerations in planning decisions to ensure that competition is not restricted unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits of the restriction to the community as a whole outweigh the costs, and the objectives can only be achieved by restricting competition. The Government also announced that the newly-established Retail Council of Australia would consider the issue.</p>
<h4 id="h4_33">3.6.2 Rise of the private label</h4>
<p>The rise of the 'value/price-conscious shopper' and the profit proposition for retailers and a better return to shareholders has largely influenced the growth and popularity of private label products (also referred to as own label, retailer brands, store brands, house brands, generics or distributor-owned brands), which account for 25 per cent of the national grocery market. Private label goods are forecast to have solid growth over the next decade rising to an estimated share of 40 per cent by 2020.<sup><a href="#fn_166" id="fnr_166">166</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="./images/fig_059.jpg" alt="An illustration of pie chart depicting the sectors of National Grocery Market Product Segmentation, 2011-12." /></p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.ibisworld.com.au/">IBISWorld</a> 2011, <em>Supermarkets and Other Grocery Stores in Australia- December 2011</em><br /><a href="#des_47">Text description for National Grocery Market Product Segmentation, 2011-12</a></p>
<p>While Australian private label growth lags behind European (53 per cent) and North American (35 per cent)<sup><a href="#fn_167" id="fnr_167">167</a></sup> markets, an increasing proportion (an estimated 57 per cent) of branded supplier's contract-manufacture for retailers. For the Private Label Manufacturers Association, private labels represent the choice and opportunity to regularly purchase quality food products at savings compared to manufacturer brands.<sup><a href="#fn_168" id="fnr_168">168</a></sup></p>
<p>Private label products have been in Australia for many decades. The catalyst for their growth was the deregulation of the dairy industry. The growth and increased popularity of private labels products in the Australian market was further assisted by the entry of German retailer ALDI in 2001. Through its offering of unknown international home-brand labels, ALDI became a viable alternative to consumers seeking value for money and cost savings in their weekly shopping. Over time, the major retailers have developed more private label merchandise to compete with this changing consumer trend, although the lack of availability of sourcing options has meant the growth of this sector has not been as rapid as has been experienced in some other countries.</p>
<p>In November 2011, Woolworths released its five-year plan to double its customer take up of own brand products. Tjeerd Jegen, Managing Director of Australian Woolworths supermarkets noted, 'our customers have given us mandate... to expand our range, lower price, further improve quality and strengthen brand presence'. Woolworths currently has three private label tiers- 850 products under 'Homebrand,' 1000 products under 'Select' and 400 lines under 'Macro' targeted at health and wellbeing.<sup><a href="#fn_169" id="fnr_169">169</a></sup> Coles has five private label tiers, 'Coles Smart Buy,' 'Coles,' 'Coles Finest', 'Coles Organic' and 'Coles Green Choice.'</p>
<p>Several well-known companies are contracted directly by the retail market to make private label products. These include (but are not limited to) Goodman Fielder, Manildra and George Weston.</p>
<p>For lower involvement commodity areas, where consumer decision-making processes are relatively simple and straightforward, such as fresh milk, private labels have a greater tendency to gain significant market share.</p>
<p>The attitude of the Australian consumer is changing. In the two-year period following the GFC, the consumer mindset has shifted to a greater willingness to try private labels (23 per cent) in categories not previously purchased. While consumers are willing to switch brands to save money, perceived value (a subjective trait among consumers) and improvements in perceived quality are also taken into consideration. For the most part, consumer sentiment suggests private labels (in some category areas) are the same if not better than their branded counterparts.<sup><a href="#fn_170" id="fnr_170">170</a></sup></p>
<p>Consumer demand for supermarket and grocery items, while driven largely by price, is also influenced by the level of real household disposable income, consumer sentiment, product availability, population levels and the economic environment. Penetration of private labels is also highly category sensitive. For high-value categories where branded manufacturers have established brand equity, there is greater reinforcement of premium positioning through investment and promotional activities. As such, movement in these categories has been relatively moderate as the perceived risk to switch to private labels is deemed higher, or loyalty to well-loved brands prevails.</p>
<p>International markets indicate a strong correlation between market concentration and private label penetration. 'In the short term, the growth of private labels may benefit consumers through lower prices for certain products. However, in the long term, Australians may be faced with less choice as the supermarket giants increase in-house offerings'.<sup><a href="#fn_171" id="fnr_171">171</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="h4_34">3.6.3 Repercussions</h4>
<p>'Private labels influence both the competition within food supply chains and the range of food products that are available to consumers. Private labels increase the range of available products and thus increase inter-brand (price) competition'.<sup><a href="#fn_172" id="fnr_172">172</a></sup></p>
<p>The growth of retailer or private label products is in direct competition to branded products. Retailers are in effect vertically integrating by contract manufacturing. This means they have some control over the whole chain and can in effect crowd out any competitors more effectively. The growth of private label products has a number of implications for upstream suppliers (manufacturers and processors), as well for consumers.</p>
<h5>Lowering prices and increasing competition</h5>
<p>Expansion of the private label range of the two big retailers is putting downward price pressure on suppliers, and if suppliers can not deliver at a lower cost, retailers may source products from other suppliers and overseas manufacturers to meet their needs. In perfectly competitive markets this leads to improved efficiencies along the value chain and lower prices for the consumer.</p>
<p>'Cannibalising' of brands can occur when the private label and the branded product are produced by the same manufacturer (retailers demand narrower margins on the private label - prices on shelves are lowered). While contract manufacturing of private labels can provide some certainty in the short-term through increases in production volumes, these manufacturers run the risk of effectively competing with themselves, potentially cannibalising their own margins, market share and reducing their long-term competitiveness.</p>
<h5>Innovations</h5>
<p>Branded suppliers note pressure to share new product development ideas 12 months from launch, often in competing product categories.<sup><a href="#fn_173" id="fnr_173">173</a></sup></p>
<p>Retailers may use innovation associated with branded product manufacturers even when the latter does not produce a similar private label product for the retailers. This may be done under coercion - the manufacturer fearing delisting. This practice confers no obligation on the part of the supermarkets to invest in their own product R&amp;D and, because of the pressure placed on supplier margins by retailers, it diminishes the ability of the suppliers to continue to invest in R&amp;D, particularly capital-intensive R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Under blind tasting, it has been shown that private labels have the potential to be mistaken for national brands. In particular, three in four taste testers were unable to differentiate between Coles-branded chocolate biscuits and the market leader, Arnott's Tim Tams<sup><a href="#fn_174" id="fnr_174">174</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Ultimately this may prove to be an unsustainable situation for investment and innovation in the Australian processed food sector.</p>
<h5>Pricing strategy and shelf-space control</h5>
<p>Retailers control the selling interface to the consumer. There is the potential for supermarkets to engage in anti-competitive behaviour when pursuing a private label strategy. Common complaints raised about private label strategies include: retailers consistently setting the retail price of branded products above private label products and private label products being provided with privileged position on shelves compared to branded products , e.g. so that the latter can't be found as easily.</p>
<p>Rod Sims, head of the ACCC, warned the supermarkets in April 2012<sup><a href="#fn_175" id="fnr_175">175</a></sup> that they risk prosecution if they are misusing their market power to favour their private labels to disadvantage other grocery brands.</p>
<h5>Copycat branding</h5>
<p>While private labels are legitimate offerings, there have been examples where retailers have produced packaging that looks very similar to established brands (e.g. colours, size and style). Manufacturers may be reluctant to take legal action with respect to passing off to remedy this situation if they fear retribution.</p>
<p>Retailers are being accused of using 'copycat' packaging to mislead consumers into buying their private label products. According to the AFGC's former Chief Executive, Kate Carnell, supermarkets are targeting brands with a strong market share and copying their designs as closely as possible without infringing trademark laws.<sup><a href="#fn_176" id="fnr_176">176</a></sup></p>
<h5>Reduction in choice</h5>
<p>Some industry commentators have suggested that the retail giants' strategy is to have a private label, the other market leader and perhaps one other across each of their product lines.</p>
<p>In most developed countries, 'the rise of private labels has put a squeeze on manufacturer's brands. But the impact has been asymmetric. It is the weaker manufacturer's brands - those that do not occupy number-one or number-two market positions - that have borne the brunt of the negative impact. The assortment strategy at many retailers with active private label programs is to accept only the top two or three manufacturer brands. They delist the rest of the weaker brands, replacing them with their own private labels. Even if the weaker brands are able to get on retailer shelves, the manufacturers have to pay disproportionate amounts in terms of retailer margins and support to persuade the retailers to stock them.'<sup><a href="#fn_177" id="fnr_177">177</a></sup></p>
<p>Certainly SMEs struggle to attain access to market when trading with large retailers. Under these conditions access to market for SMEs through the large retailers is likely to prove increasingly difficult, especially if the major retailers continue to increase their market share.</p>
<p>It is claimed that it is difficult for SMEs to get access to customers as the two big retailers are limiting variety on their shelves. For example, in the period 2008-10 Coles' and Woolworths' share of sales by volume of their private labels in the retail grocery sector grew from 76 to 92 per cent for tomato paste and from 82 to 84 per cent for frozen fish.<sup><a href="#fn_178" id="fnr_178">178</a></sup></p>
<p>Industry participation has experienced a considerable decrease in the number of small-scale operations, which are being steadily replaced by larger businesses. The number of business enterprises has declined over the last five years as have the number of business establishments.<sup><a href="#fn_179" id="fnr_179">179</a></sup></p>
<p>Australian food manufacturers need to become more innovative to protect their brands and look for alternative customers (either domestically or overseas). Increases in market share are forecast for companies which increase their online sales presence. It is estimated that within two years 33 per cent of large companies in the food and beverage industry expect to sell online; accounting on average, for 16 per cent of total sales.<sup><a href="#fn_180" id="fnr_180">180</a></sup> This will reduce the buyer power of the major retailers.</p>

<h3 id="h3_22">3.7 Future Consumer Demands and Trends</h3>
<p>The food industry is in a state of transition. Changes to consumer demand mean opportunities exist for companies to increase revenue growth if they can actively engage with market trends. Food and beverage companies (domestic and international) were asked to rate consumer trends which offer the greatest opportunity for growth in <em>Managing through uncertainty: Food and beverage industry in transition</em> (the Grant Thornton International Business Report 2011). Of these trends, health and well-being, in-home cooking, and natural and/or organic were seen to provide the best avenues for strategic direction.</p>
<p>Healthy eating, a critical consumer driver, will have considerable influence over company strategies within the next few years. Mintel Research describes the rise of 'healthy snackers', those who choose to consume snacks that are healthier than others, while reducing consumption of less-healthy nibbles.<sup><a href="#fn_181" id="fnr_181">181</a></sup> While consumers look for 'healthy' options, more often than not they are confused by a lack of transparency and definitional guidelines. For example, organic products are those 'not enhanced', while functional foods usually signify 'enhanced'.<sup><a href="#fn_182" id="fnr_182">182</a></sup></p>
<p>Trend cycles emerge more rapidly as a result of technological advancements, accelerated social change, instantaneous communication and consumer acceptance (or inability to escape) of new ideas and concepts. It is worth noting that unless a product innovation gains consumer acceptance, it will be overlooked irrespective of how unique or 'on-trend' it is. According to market research provider DataMonitor, there are eight megatrends influencing the modern consumer marketplace (see <strong><a href="#fig_3-17">Figure 3.17</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Megatrends capture the bigger global market picture reflecting consumer values, attitudes and societal change. Megatrends can exist as counter-trends, can crossover or can be inter-dependent. This reflects the inherent complexity of consumer behaviour. Yet with this complexity there is potential for market opportunities. Pressures from input factors of raw material availability (the greatest cost component within the sector), people and skills (the high proportion of low skilled workers and the reduction in high skilled employees), packaging (an industry in constant flux) and freight (high cost coupled with lack of transportation mode alternatives) will no doubt continue to influence the productivity of the sector.</p>
<p id="fig_3-17">Figure 3.17: Global Consumer Megatrends</p>
<p><img src="./images/fig_061.jpg" alt="Chart showing the Global Consumer Megatrends" /></p>
<p>Source: Datamonitor 2012, <em>Trendsights: Tomorrow's Consumer Brand Landscape</em><br /><a href="#des_48">Text description for Global Consumer Megatrends</a></p>
<p>When respondents to the 2011 PwC survey were asked to identify what they thought drove consumer purchasing decisions, 67 businesses felt that consumers primarily wanted lower prices. Sixty businesses said consumers wanted new products, 58 businesses said consumers wanted consistent quality and 50 businesses said consumers wanted better nutritional value products. A qualitative observation drawn from these results is that the trend towards lower prices was more apparent in the seafood, dairy and grain cereal industries.</p>
<p>However, while Investment opportunities can be difficult for SMEs to access due to financial constraints, all companies (SMEs, larger businesses, multi-nationals) understand the importance of R&amp;D and have continued to invest if somewhat moderately in innovation. The operational requirements of the sector continue to grow, especially in new Asian markets, where population growth is being accompanied by rapidly increasing income levels. Investment into new capital equipment is trending upwards and companies are looking at new ways to improve their energy, water and reduce waste levels to transition into a low-carbon future. There are also opportunities for the food processing sector to utilise new technologies to address future predicted food shortages. Industry transformation strategies are discussed further in <a href="#h2_12"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 id="h3_23">3.8 Summary</h3>
<p>The current operating environment in Australia provides food processors with a range of opportunities and challenges. The most significant challenges are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An uncompetitive cost base and shallow profit pool - Australian businesses cite the lack of availability of affordable raw materials as a major factor in reduced Australian competitiveness. Lately the high Australian dollar has meant that the cost of Australian raw materials can be considerably higher than in competitor countries and, as a result, it has been harder for suppliers to compete with imports.</li>
<li>A challenging regulatory environment - while Australia is held in high regard worldwide for its safe and clean food supply there are still a number of issues associated with the application of Australian food standards and related regulation including: differences in food safety regulations and enforcement between the States and Territories; the ability of New Zealand to choose to vary or opt out of some standards; and the costs and time delays in changes to the Food Standards Code</li>
<li>A hostile retail environment - the growth of 'retailer or private label' products in direct competition to branded products. Retailers are in effect vertically integrating by contract manufacturing. This means they have some control over the whole chain and can in effect crowd out more effectively any competitors. The growth of private label products has a number of implications for upstream suppliers - manufacturers and processors as well for consumers.</li>

These figures are estimates because boundaries across research areas are often not black and white. For example, some things (such as developing a new strain of high fibre grain) might be classed as "health" or "crop" research rather than "food" research. In this case CSIRO would regard the early stage development of breed engineering as crop research, the middle stage where applications of the product are being explored as "food" research and the latter stages where the particular health benefits are developed as "health" research.</p>

The ACCC in its 2008 inquiry into the retail sector preferred a bilateral bargaining power model (as opposed to a monopsony model) as the more appropriate analytical framework to analyse buyer power in the food and grocery retail industry. It based this on the belief that grocery supply markets are a series of bilateral relationships rather than wholesale markets, and trading terms are negotiated individually with each supplier. As a result, ACCC contends that any judgements on impact of buyer power on suppliers must be based on evidence from specific factual situations, and not on whole market. But their conclusions are the same - grocery retailers still have substantial buyer power and are able to influence price and trading terms to their advantage.</p>

<!-- chapter 4 -->
<h2 id="h2_11">4. Opportunities and Threats</h2>                                
<p>If Australia is to increase employment and investment in the food processing industry, it must innovate, grow and improve its sustainability, and exploit more effectively its significant natural and other advantages in the growing and processing of food. To win in the international market and to grow domestically, Australia's food processing industry needs to capitalise on its strengths, harness opportunities and mitigate its weaknesses. In addition, Australia must address a number of impediments to future sustainable growth including the key issue of access to markets, domestically and overseas, among others. This chapter identifies the strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities for the industry.</p>
<h3 id="h3_24">4.1 SWOT Results</h3>
<p>The Strategy Group undertook an analysis of 'strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats' (a SWOT). The group noted that the food processing industry already has a good track record with some outstanding sectors, that Australia has strong natural advantages, is good at growing food, has an educated multicultural workforce and has a well-developed entrepreneurial spirit. In addition, Australia's public research facilities can facilitate innovation in the industry. Australia needs a strong framework to underpin sustainable development of our natural resources, exploit counter-seasonal opportunities and maximise export opportunities in Asia.</p>
<p>Australia's excellent food safety credentials, its disease-free status, strong regulatory regimes and innovations in traceability, quality assurance and supply chains, are considered by international analysts to be important factors in the food industry's future domestic and export success. The Strategy Group confirmed these conclusions in its SWOT. Individual items from the overall SWOT analysis from this survey are listed in <strong><a href="#tbl_4-1">Table 4.1</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#tbl_4-2">Table 4.2</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Many of the items generated by the SWOT were supported by insights from the PwC industry survey of 92 food companies (see <strong><a href="#fig_4-1">Figures 4.1</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#fig_4-2">4.2</a></strong>).</p>

<h4 id="h4_35">4.2.1 Reputation for product safety and high-quality, including disease-free status</h4>
<p>Australia has an international reputation for clean, green, safe and high-quality foods and that includes high-value-added products that are convenient, nutritious and targeted to consumer needs. Australia has responded to concerns about food safety which have emerged over the last decade as a result of a number of international crises by developing a comprehensive regulatory system covering domestic and international food trade.</p>
<p>The Asian market is increasingly looking for high-quality, safe and clean overseas branded products to purchase, which creates enormous opportunities for high-quality Australian exports. However, Asia is not a monoculture and strategies need to take this into consideration.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the businesses participating in the PwC industry survey claimed that using the label 'Australian made, Australian grown' provided them with a competitive edge, particularly within the seafood, fruit/veg, and grain/cereal industries.</p>
<p>There have been a number of previous government supported campaigns to capitalise on Asian markets, such as Supermarket to Asia, and the current Australian Government initiative, Australia in the Asian Century, which is focused on identifying and exploiting opportunities associated with a growing middle-class in a number of Asian countries.</p>
<h4 id="h4_36">4.2.2 Large, high-quality public research institutions</h4>
<p>Australia has high-quality researchers, research institutes and universities. Australia has a higher than the world average of citations in the research fields of geosciences, physics, plant and animal sciences, and agricultural sciences.<sup><a href="#fn_183" id="fnr_183">183</a></sup></p>
<p>We have significant R&amp;D capacity and capability in food products in Australia including at the CSIRO, Rural Research and Development Corporations (RDCs), the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI), Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) and through Australian Research Council (ARC) grants.</p>
<p>Apart from the CSIRO, none of the listed organisations specifically funds R&amp;D in food processing. The focus of all RDCs, and all current relevant CRCs are pre-'farm gate'. This has the effect of distorting the R&amp;D environment with strong public investment on farm, but very little in the post- 'farm gate' sector, which generates most of the final consumer value.</p>
<p>In the 2011 PwC survey, out of 92 respondents, 44 businesses had partnered with an organisation for research purposes within the last five years. Governments and universities were the most popular organisations to provide partners (27 businesses). Satisfaction with the outcome was relatively high overall (67 businesses) and 77 businesses felt they had an influence on the direction of the research undertaken. However, results from the recent Victorian survey on the need for pilot plant facilities suggested that many Victorian food processors were not engaging very much with public research organisations, but when they did, satisfaction levels were not high.<sup><a href="#fn_184" id="fnr_184">184</a></sup></p>
<p>New technologies and insights represent a major opportunity to build greater knowledge among consumers about the value of food in providing for short-term wellness and long-term health. According to the CSIRO, only a small percentage of Australia's thousands of food companies have the time and resources to take advantage of the new technologies crucial to advancing their business operations. For most small to medium enterprises, technical innovation can provide a unique and sustainable competitive advantage. Increasingly, it is seen as an investment in future market leadership as the capacity to manage technology uptake drives company growth.</p>
<p>Developing improved capability to take up new technology is vital to the survival of the food industry in Australia. The CSIRO is already tackling these issues on a number of fronts; for example, a process developed by Victorian-based Roma Foods, in collaboration with CSIRO, to make rice and maize gluten-free pasta spirals.<sup><a href="#fn_185" id="fnr_185">185</a></sup> But more can be done. Project partnerships with rural research and development corporations, universities and other research bodies can link outcomes championed by industry bodies and agri-food companies.<sup><a href="#fn_186" id="fnr_186">186</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="h4_37">4.2.3 Available energy, raw materials and land for large-scale productive farming</h4>
<p>Food production is inextricably connected with resource allocation, land use, trade, employment, and energy and water usage. While Australia has a good environment for the production of raw materials, concerns have been expressed about the urban encroachment, mining and the use of crops for biofuels as issues to watch if this capacity is not to be diminished.<sup><a href="#fn_187" id="fnr_187">187</a></sup></p>
<p>Climatic differences within the Australian continent, from the tropical north to the cooler south, contribute to the extensive range of produce grown in the country. With its southern hemisphere location, Australia offers counter-seasonal produce to northern hemisphere produce seasons.<sup><a href="#fn_188" id="fnr_188">188</a></sup></p>
<p>'Productivity of Australian farms, measuring the efficiency of using inputs to produce a specific level of outputs, has risen strongly for cropping specialists and the mixed crop-livestock industry - averaging 2.1 per cent and 1.5 per cent a year respectively from 1977-78 to 2006-07. Beef specialists achieved the same average performance level as the mixed crop livestock industry over the past three decades. Their productivity growth coincided with high output growth and relatively marginal growth in input use.</p>
<p>'The sheep industry continues to lag behind the broad-acre sector in terms of long-term productivity growth. Between 1977-78 and 2006-07, the industry has experienced a decline in both output and input use. However, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) warns that broad-acre productivity has slowed since the turn of the century, after surging in the 1990s. This is partly attributable to droughts in 2002-03 and 2006-07.'<sup><a href="#fn_189" id="fnr_189">189</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> discusses issues related to costs of inputs and the competitiveness of Australia with respect to raw material inputs. Historically high, recent increases in the Australian dollar have reduced that competitiveness.</p>
<p>A variety of energy sources are available in Australia to large-scale farming and manufacturing. These sources include gas, coal and renewable energies. Fifty-one per cent of businesses participating in the PwC industry survey said that their energy costs contributed 1 to 5 per cent of their overall costs. Sixty-one per cent of businesses said that water costs were between 1 and 5 per cent. According to the World Bank,<sup><a href="#fn_190" id="fnr_190">190</a></sup> Australia is placed 37th in the ranking of 183 economies on the ease of getting electricity and historically our electricity is low-cost by world standards.<sup><a href="#fn_191" id="fnr_191">191</a></sup> No doubt emissions pricing and adoption of low-emission technologies will cause comparatively small increases in the cost of electricity generation, but the more significant price pressures on electricity generation reside outside of the carbon price context, e.g. electricity infrastructure costs, and the declining availability of cheap alternatives to petroleum, the latter which may have reached its production peak.</p>
<p>There is an issue associated with the use of farmland for non-farming purposes such as mining. Conversion of farmland to mining has the potential to reduce agricultural production, whether the mining companies are Australian or foreign-owned. However, the investment in infrastructure, such as improved roads, that typically accompanies mining developments is likely to benefit agriculture.</p>
<p>'Australia's food security is likely to be further enhanced by ongoing foreign investment in agriculture. For the economy as a whole, the flow of foreign funds leads to higher aggregate production in the economy and thus to higher incomes, which improve consumers' capacity to purchase food'<sup><a href="#fn_192" id="fnr_192">192</a></sup>.</p>
<h4 id="h4_38">4.2.4 Educated, innovative, motivated and multicultural workforce</h4>
<p>Some 4.4 million people living in Australia, representing approximately a quarter of the country's population, were born overseas, with substantial representation from European, Asian and Middle Eastern countries.<sup><a href="#fn_193" id="fnr_193">193</a></sup> The 2006 Census of Population and Housing found that, in August 2006, 3.1 million people (16 per cent of the population) spoke a language other than English at home and that this cultural diversity within the population has resulted in over 200 different languages spoken in homes around the country.</p>
<p>Almost 1.2 million Australians are fluent in major European languages, apart from English, and nearly 1.5 million speak an Asian language at home (with more than 500 000 speaking a Chinese dialect).<sup><a href="#fn_194" id="fnr_194">194</a></sup> Mandarin is now the second-most common language spoken at home other than English, according to the 2011 Census, taking over the spot from Italian. Opportunities exist to capitalise on the richness of experience among Australian workers. Managers could increase productivity by greater use of employee insights and ideas, while understanding cultural sensitivities.</p>
<p>In addition, this diversity will continue to lead to a demand for a variety of foods. Many specialty products have European, Asian and Middle Eastern influences, and kosher, halal and organic foods have provided opportunities for food processing manufacturer particularly in the meat processing sector.</p>
<p>Australia's linguistic diversity, the proficiency with which the languages are spoken, and strong cultural links with Europe and Asia, provide an ideal mix for multinational organisations setting up or expanding their business in Australia.</p>
<p>The Australian workforce is also highly educated. In May 2009, of the 14.4 million people aged 15-64 years, 8 million (55 per cent) held at least one non-school qualification. These comprised 3.3 million whose highest non-school qualification was a Bachelor degree or above. A further 1.3 million reported an Advanced Diploma or Diploma, 2.3 million reported a Certificate III or IV and 0.7 million reported a Certificate I or II as their highest qualification.<sup><a href="#fn_195" id="fnr_195">195</a></sup> Australia is ranked sixth in the OECD education rankings, behind South Korea, Finland, Canada, New Zealand and Japan.</p>
<h4 id="h4_39">4.2.5 Economic fundamentals are sound and domestic market is growing (albeit slowly)</h4>
<p>In a recent edition of its twice-yearly report about the global economy, the IMF noted that while economic recovery in major advanced economies will be "relatively sluggish", Australia and the newly industrialised Asian economies are off to a strong start and will likely stay in the lead.<sup><a href="#fn_196" id="fnr_196">196</a></sup></p>
<p>The IMF says Australia's economic growth is expected to be 3 per cent in 2012 and 3.5 per cent in 2013. According to the IMF, growth in Australia will be helped by strong demand for commodities, particularly from China. The report suggests that the economic outlook for Australia remains favorable despite the recent uncertainty on global financial markets. But risks remain. These include a stalling global recovery, and faltering Asian growth which would impact the demand for commodities.</p>
<p>According to the Heritage Foundation and the <em>Wall Street Journal's</em> Annual 2012 Index of Economic Freedom, Australia has an economic freedom score of 83.1, ranking third overall in the 2012 Index. Its overall score is 0.6 points higher than last year, reflecting better scores in trade freedom, government spending and fiscal freedom.</p>
<p>Australia, with a low population density and relatively low crime rates, continues to supply some of the world's most livable cities. In a ranking of 140 cities around the world, Melbourne was given a score of 97.5 per cent. Other Australian cities in the top 10 include Sydney, which ranked sixth-best - up from seventh in the previous survey, while Perth and Adelaide ranked unchanged with a joint eighth slot.<sup><a href="#fn_197" id="fnr_197">197</a></sup> Nearly 60 per cent of Australia's processed food businesses are located in Victoria and NSW.</p>
<p>Australia's modern and competitive economy benefits from the country's strong commitment to open-market policies that facilitate global trade and investment.</p>
<h4 id="h4_40">4.2.6 Stable and open political system including intellectual property enforcement</h4>
<p>The foundations of economic freedom in Australia are strong and well supported by excellent protection of property rights and an independent judiciary that enforces anti-corruption measures effectively.</p>
<p>Australia is a safe destination for investment. The country's political and regulatory environment is stable, open and progressive providing investors with a high degree of confidence and certainty. Australia has been ranked equal first along with Canada, Norway and Switzerland out of 193 countries surveyed by credit ratings agency Dun &amp; Bradstreet as a safe and secure destination for investment in its recently released report, <em>Risk 2012 - The Economic and Risk Outlook.</em><sup><a href="#fn_198" id="fnr_198">198</a></sup></p>
<p>Australia's strength as an investment destination stems, in part, from a political system that has been assessed as being highly effective in responding to economic challenges and policy directions. According to the IMD 2011 World Competitiveness Rankings, Australia was ranked ninth out of 59 economies.<sup><a href="#fn_199" id="fnr_199">199</a></sup> The adaptability of Australian Government policy to changes in the economy, and the transparency and effectiveness of government were all rated highly.</p>
<p>Australia's stable political system and government ensures an open and progressive legal and regulatory environment, providing business with a high degree of certainty. Regulation of Australian financial markets is viewed internationally as a model of best practice - both responsible and prudent. This confidence has encouraged a steady flow of foreign investment, boosted by a strong and robust intellectual property framework and business-friendly policies.</p>
<h4 id="h4_41">4.2.7 New R&amp;D Tax Incentive may encourage innovation and investment</h4>
<p>Private sector investment in technology and product innovation is also crucial to success. Australia's expenditure on R&amp;D as a per cent of GDP in 2008 was 2.24 per cent, 0.11 per cent below the OECD average of 2.35 per cent.<sup><a href="#fn_200" id="fnr_200">200</a></sup></p>
<p>According to <em>a 2011 survey of Australian CEOs</em><sup><a href="#fn_201" id="fnr_201">201</a></sup> 74 per cent of those in the food and beverage industry were investing more than 1 per cent of sales in new product development, and 11 per cent invested more than 5 per cent of their sales. Interestingly, the amount of product development expenditure did not vary in accordance with company size but did depend on the degree of senior management commitment.</p>
<p>In the 2011 PwC survey while most of the 92 businesses interviewed indicated the amount invested in innovation was relatively low (69 companies invested less than 5 per cent), the majority of businesses within the sector (84) claimed to invest in it to some degree. The survey indicated that industries more likely to invest in R&amp;D (between 1 and 5 per cent) were dairy, fruit/vegetables, oil/fat, and grain/cereal. Businesses were more likely to spend money on R&amp;D in order to gain a competitive edge - be that through new products or processes. A key unanswered question here is the extent to which the R&amp;D spend by the industry is realising a full return on that investment.</p>
<p>The R&amp;D Tax Concession was introduced in 1985 to encourage Australian industry to undertake more R&amp;D activities. During the period from 26 November 2007 to 30 September 2010, 642 food-related companies registered for the R&amp;D Tax Concession.</p>
<p>In the 2007 Deloitte study of the use of R&amp;D in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry, a large component of which were food and beverage businesses, Deloitte found that 93 per cent of those surveyed had accessed the R&amp;D Tax Concession.<sup><a href="#fn_202" id="fnr_202">202</a></sup></p>
<p>In the PwC industry survey only 48 companies of the 92 surveyed claimed to have accessed the R&amp;D Tax Concession. Businesses within the meat, seafood, oil/fat industries were the most likely to have accessed it. This has now been replaced with the R&amp;D Tax Incentive (see <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> ) - the design of which should increase investment from multinationals and small businesses.</p>
<h3 id="h3_26">4.3 Weaknesses</h3>
<h4 id="h4_42">4.3.1 Economies of scale</h4>
<p>Australia's relatively small population and large geographical spread pose a significant impediment to business returns. The scale issue impacts everyone along the supply chain, from growers to packaging companies, freight companies and retail outlets.</p>
<p>With stable household expenditure on food (of around 16.45 per cent<sup><a href="#fn_203" id="fnr_203">203</a></sup>) in Australia, growth of the food manufacturing sector is closely linked to domestic population growth and growth in overseas demand for Australian food products. Export from an island continent is comparatively expensive - sea or air are the only options (since air is costly, sea needs to be cheap and efficient).</p>
<p>The global food industry is dominated by large, multinational firms, and the Australian market reflects that trend. Almost half of the largest 50 firms are foreign-owned companies. Multinational corporations choose to invest where there is the greatest return on investment unless other strategic reasons prevail. Newly built plants overseas have huge scale and this makes them cost competitive. The strong Australian dollar adds to Australia's lack of competitiveness.</p>
<p>Australian manufacturers which are potentially able to achieve world scale (to be efficient, pass on cost savings, and to compete with imports that are being manufactured from world scale plants overseas) should, all other things being equal, be allowed to achieve that scale. Our small market size and costs to export markets (burdened by a sustained strong Australian dollar) mean that Australia has become a comparatively poor platform for manufacturing despite our natural resources and other advantages. Efficiencies can be attained with scale and scale needs significant capital investment.</p>
<p>Many businesses operate with surplus capacity. One major flour miller stated that the industry as a whole has surplus capacity of 46 per cent. Large millers compete for a declining per capita consumption through intense price competition. Smaller operators generally remain competitive because of a localised market in which larger operators cannot compete due to the cost of transporting flour. Small millers do not normally compete directly with the large companies because they have small niche local markets. However, one small miller indicated that the company lost 50 per cent of sales in 2000 due to a major competitor initiating price competition (although these sales have now recovered to 75 per cent of the previous level).</p>
<p>Similarly to flour mills, those oil processors which have a strong link with the farmers producing their canola are able to obtain an important competitive advantage. Ensuring the appropriate cultivar affects product quality (suitability for oil refinement) and quantity (oil content of seeds).</p>
<p>In Australia, processing plants crushing oilseeds are located close to oilseed-growing areas. Processing plants which refine vegetable oils are generally situated in capital cities. Locating plants close to metropolitan areas minimises transport costs for refrigerating the final product.</p>
<p>Without a significant increase in the domestic or export markets, further consolidation of the sector is the only means of getting scale. Current competition law and recent practice appears able to facilitate that consolidation, as well as preventing an unintended consequence of diminished competition as the result of that consolidation.</p>
<p>Several members of the Strategy Group have indicated that attempts by their companies to initiate vertical mergers (i.e. the sharing of assets in a couple of specific areas) were not progressed because independent legal advice suggested that these initiatives would be seen by ACCC as restricting industry capacity and hence would not be allowed. Strategy Group members also indicated that the consequences of having a proposed 'deal' rejected are devastating, so that a company would only take a proposal to the ACCC when it believed that it was 95 per cent likely to go through.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that some proposals for the sharing of assets are never tested with the ACCC, only a few of the high-volume, low-value-add food oil and flour milling acquisitions tested with the ACCC since 2002 have been opposed (see <strong><a href="appendices.html#h3_39">Appendix D</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Moreover, industry feedback on these sectors from a report commissioned by DIISRTE was mixed, in regard to the benefits of increased consolidation. Stakeholders commented that consolidation keeps overheads such as head office costs down, and can allow for economies of a scale in sourcing and producing products; however, it adds to higher distribution costs, which somewhat dissipate the effects of the economies of scale.<sup><a href="#fn_204" id="fnr_204">204</a></sup></p>
<p>It should also be noted that the ACCC's Merger guidelines 2008 allow businesses that want to informally explore proposed mergers, acquisitions or asset-sharing to have a confidential discussion with the ACCC.<sup><a href="#fn_205" id="fnr_205">205</a></sup></p>
<p>Industry has also raised concerns that under section 50 (the merger provisions) of the <em>Competition and Consumer Act 2010</em> (CCA), there is inadequate consideration of gains in economic efficiency that may result from a merger, or the wider public benefits a merger may bring to the economy when it applies the 'substantial lessening of competition' (SLC) test. Also with respect to manufactured foods, given international competition, a wide definition of the market is applicable</p>
<p>These issues have been raised by industry in the past with the Government regarding the <em>Trade Practices Act</em> (as the CCA was formerly known). A review was undertaken by a committee headed by Sir Daryl Dawson, a former Judge of the High Court of Australia in 2002 (the Dawson Committee). The Dawson Committee found that the merger provisions of the CCA were adequate. In relation to the third issue of industry being uncertain about the ACCC's approach to mergers and its reluctance to test the authorisation process, the Dawson Committee recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the ACCC should provide adequate reasons for its decisions (taking care to protect any confidentiality) in the informal clearance process when requested to do so by the parties and in cases where it has rejected a merger or accepted undertakings (Recommendation 2.1). The Dawson Committee considered that the provision of reasons in these instances would allow a better understanding of the ACCC's decisions and reduce uncertainty about the way in which the process operates.</li>
<li>The Committee also recommended the introduction of an optional formal clearance system that would operate alongside the informal system so that, should the parties so wish, the ACCC's decision with respect to a merger could be appealed to the Tribunal (Recommendation 2.2). Given the nature of the informal system, which focuses on expediency and does not require the ACCC to provide detailed reasons for its decision, there had been no course to appeal the ACCC's decision. However, parties did still have the option to seek a declaration from the Federal Court that a proposed merger would not breach section 50 (see <em>AGL v ACCC</em>, 2003).</li>
<li>To encourage the take-up of the authorisations process in relation to mergers, the application for authorisation of mergers should be made directly to the Tribunal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Government response accepted the Dawson Committee's recommendations in relation to mergers.</p>
<p>The Committee supported the preservation of the existing structure of the competition provisions such that the promotion of competition would continue to be the merger provisions' (i.e. section 50's) primary objective, while consideration of 'public benefit' considerations could be undertaken by virtue of the authorisation process. Further, the Committee recommended that the Competition Tribunal rather than the ACCC should undertake the broader efficiency assessment by virtue of authorisation. This has been put in place.</p>
<p>The Committee also considered the suggestion that a wider definition of market would enable the ACCC, in determining the likely effect of a merger on competition, to consider whether the merger would enable the merged entity to compete more effectively in a global market. The Committee noted that the issue raised there is whether the gains to the merged entity would warrant possible detriment to domestic consumers by the reduction of competition in the domestic market. The Committee considered that these matters can be considered on an application for authorisation and are best considered there. The benefits claimed for a proposed merger internationally can then be assessed alongside the impact of the proposal on domestic competition.</p>
<p>The ACCC has flagged a possible new process for acquisitions by Woolworths and Wesfarmers - designed to create a more streamlined system for the businesses and ensure the ACCC has relevant information up front.<sup><a href="#fn_206" id="fnr_206">206</a></sup></p>
<p>In return for advanced notice of a wider range of acquisitions, and for particular information being provided upfront with each transaction, the ACCC would establish a dedicated team to assess these transactions within specified times.</p>
<p>The ACCC has stated that those discussions have just begun and it remains to be seen whether or not the arrangements can be implemented. The ACCC has not indicated an intention to expand the proposed arrangements to any other businesses apart from Westfarmers and Woolworths.</p>
<h5>Collective bargaining</h5>
<p>Collective bargaining under the CCA is an arrangement under which two or more competitors in an industry come together to negotiate terms and conditions (which can include price) with a supplier or a customer. Ordinarily such arrangements can raise competition concerns but such arrangements can be allowed by the ACCC under the CCA where there is sufficient public interest from the arrangement.</p>
<p>Authorisation under the CCA allows businesses to obtain protection for arrangements that may breach the competition provisions of the Act, including collective bargaining arrangements. The assessment process for an authorisation application would ordinarily take about six months to complete but under a streamlined process - interim authorisation - for collective bargaining, the ACCC will seek to issue its final determination within three months of receiving the application for authorisation.</p>
<p>Since 2006, there have been six collective bargaining applications that relate to the food processing sector, mainly in relation to the dairy industry. The sectors that tend to utilise collective bargaining tend to have a fairly strong industry body representing them (such as the dairy industry).Given the potential financial benefits of collective bargaining, especially to SMEs, the comparative failure of the processed food industry to utilise this process may be explained by a lack of awareness of the collective bargaining process.</p>
<h4 id="h4_43">4.3.2 Labour costs are higher than in some developed and all developing countries</h4>
<p>Australia is a country with a high cost of living which puts pressure on wage rates. Labour costs in Australia are relatively high compared with other developed countries.<sup><a href="#fn_207" id="fnr_207">207</a></sup></p>
<p>The high cost of labour makes decisions to replace labour with automation easy, despite redundancy costs. In the meat processing sector, for example, there has been significant consolidation and rationalisation in the supply chain with wholesale operations being integrated into processing activities and large-scale retailers bypassing wholesalers. This consolidation has resulted in greater efficiencies and initial job losses. However higher automation means that there is a greater need for trade and engineering skills (restructuring to a higher-paid workforce). The trend toward greater mechanisation of food and beverage processing also potentially diminishes the significance of labour costs in Australia's comparative competitiveness, but perhaps not materially so in the short term.</p>
<p>In the PwC industry survey, 38 businesses claimed labour costs made up 20 per cent or more of their overall costs, and 57 businesses indicated that employee numbers had increased over the past five years.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in many high-volume, low-value add sectors such as food oils and flour milling, employee numbers are small and capital costs high per factory, so the impact of high wages is not so great. Less than 4000 jobs exist in food oils and flour milling. While the percentage cost of Australian labour may be high, it is unclear whether this will significantly affect profit margins in the longer term, especially with greater capital investment.</p>
<p>Labour productivity is a key measure of economic performance. Globalisation has enabled corporations to relocate secondary operations to countries where the cost of labour and/or equipment is low. If the place of operation is also close to the market where the products will be sold, then the company benefits again from lower distributions costs.</p>
<p>Australia's manufacturing industry including the food processing sector, for example, has suffered because labour costs in some nearby developing countries are cheaper than the equivalent labour costs here and much of our export product is destined for the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<h5>Land at risk and factories expensive to set up</h5>
<p>The area of productive land in Australia is diminishing due to increasing urbanisation and various degradation processes. For example, the National Land and Water Resources Audit's risk assessment (NLWRA, 2000) identified approximately 5.7 million hectares of land to be within regions at risk of, or affected by, dry land salinity, with this area increasing over time. Soil erosion is common in lands used for food production, with a tendency for erosion rates to be higher in the north and lower in the south-west of the continent. A further 23 million hectares of land is estimated to have acidification in subsurface layers.<sup><a href="#fn_208" id="fnr_208">208</a></sup> The use of emerging technologies such as GMO to facilitate the growing of grains, for example, in degraded land, represents an opportunity here.</p>
<p>The planning system is a crucial factor in achieving a sufficient supply of new housing and commercial developments; however, it also impacts on affordability. In Australia concerns have been expressed about the indirect and often unpredictable costs that arise from planned intervention in the land and housing market, direct costs associated with complying with building and design controls, time taken to secure approval, fees and charges for administration, infrastructure or other public services associated with development.<sup><a href="#fn_209" id="fnr_209">209</a></sup> The World Bank's <em>Doing Business</em> index ranked Australia 42 out of 183 economies for dealing with construction permits and 38 out of 183 economies for registering a property<sup><a href="#fn_210" id="fnr_210">210</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Access to investment funds and new technologies are also two of the most critical inputs for the production of substantially and elaborately transformed foods as most manufacturing processes are capital-intensive. Access and costs of distribution within a region or country are also important. As a result, the location of manufactured food production facilities is not necessarily dependent on the availability of the natural resource endowments required to produce raw material inputs.<sup><a href="#fn_211" id="fnr_211">211</a></sup></p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council (PMSEIC) commented on the fact of 'rising land prices, particularly in peri-urban areas' [i.e. those regions between urban and rural areas]<sup><a href="#fn_212" id="fnr_212">212</a></sup>, the effect of which is, not only to cause a shift in arable land for food production, but also to increase costs to manufacturers when establishing factories and plants.</p>
<h5>Freight costs to reach market are high</h5>
<p>Australia is a large continent with a small population located on its coastal fringe. As a result, logistics are a major reason for preventing businesses from achieving greater sales and scale.</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> , 46 of 83 businesses that responded to the PwC industry survey identified transport as being more than 5 per cent of their overall costs. In a study of the food oil industry, transport costs in this sector were found to be 7 per cent of the overall costs.<sup><a href="#fn_213" id="fnr_213">213</a></sup></p>
<p>For a significant fraction of food freight there is no alternative to road transport, as the rail network is far less extensive than the road network. Furthermore, the flexibility and reliability of road transport is preferred for time-sensitive food freight, particularly perishable foods.</p>
<p>There is some concern in the industry that the consolidation of food and grocery retailers, that is, the retail 'duopoly', is affecting freight costs. In order to increase their market share, the major Australian retailers have followed European and US trends to retail liquor, fuel, newsagency products, and movement to control the food freight chain: both primary freight from the supplier to retailer's distribution centre and secondary freight from the distribution centre to the supermarket.</p>
<h4 id="h4_44">4.3.3 High levels of regulatory burden and inconsistent regulation</h4>
<p>The Australia and New Zealand food regulatory system and some issues related to the system are described in <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> .</p>
<p>Compliance with government and supplier regulation was regarded as a significant cost to businesses canvassed in the PwC industry survey. Fifty-nine businesses said that compliance with government regulations made up for 10 per cent of their costs and compliance with supplier regulations up to another 10 per cent. One Australian firm told the Strategy Group that in the past year it had conducted 51 food audits at a direct cost of $150 000 and an opportunity cost of $1 million.</p>
<p>In their submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Australia's Food Processing Sector, Mrs Mac's<sup><a href="#fn_214" id="fnr_214">214</a></sup> said that there was a need for audit and food safety consistency across the country; Summerfruit<sup><a href="#fn_215" id="fnr_215">215</a></sup> indicated that the regulatory environment was stifling food production; Campbell Arnott<sup><a href="#fn_216" id="fnr_216">216</a></sup> highlighted the complexity of the regulatory regime; Lion<sup><a href="#fn_217" id="fnr_217">217</a></sup> said that there were a number of regulatory regimes that pose a significant burden on the food industry, including those relating to container waste management, food labelling, preventative health and environmental requirements, as well as the proposed carbon price mechanism, and the Australian Meat Industry Council<sup><a href="#fn_218" id="fnr_218">218</a></sup> argued that red meat processing was under pressure in Australia due to regulatory compliance costs at a local, state and federal level, including a range of food standards, environmental regulations, occupational health and safety and export certification.</p>
<p>The Productivity Commission's <em>Performance Benchmarking of Australian and New Zealand Business Regulation: Food Safety Research Report</em> (the Report), released on 22 December 2009, benchmarked indicators of regulatory burden associated with food safety regimes across Australian jurisdictions and New Zealand. Findings of the Report included:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the regulatory structure governing the food industry is complex and inconsistent</li>
<li>that little progress has been made in the area of harmonising primary production and processing regulatory regimes</li>
<li>for businesses operating in one jurisdiction, the burden of compliance varied, depending on the regulatory regime in place</li>
<li>that several regulatory differences between jurisdictions had the potential to increase costs for those businesses operating across jurisdictional borders and</li>
<li>that greater consistency could potentially increase competition and productivity, resulting in lower prices to consumers and decreased costs to the food industry.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Food labelling</h5>
<p>Food labelling plays a critical role as a primary interface between suppliers and consumers. It is a finite space, subject to an increasing demand to contain more information.</p>
<p>Claims made on food labels must be accurate and verifiable. Many food labels are general in nature, based on average measurements, manufacturers' declarations (which may or may not be externally validated by laboratory testing); or - as is often the case with nutrition information panels - calculated or derived from technical literature.</p>
<p>Australia has two well-established, collaborative and rigorous regulatory frameworks (consumer law and food regulation) that monitor food standards and safety. Together they produce considerable net benefits to the community and aim to achieve minimum effective regulation. However, the operation of the current frameworks across a number of areas needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code) contains a standard requiring labelling and naming of ingredients in foods. A Memorandum of Understanding facilitates cooperation and coordination between FSANZ and the ACCC in relation to areas of overlap between the Code and the <em>Competition and Consumer Act 2010</em>, particularly in the area of false or misleading labels.</p>
<p>At the request of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council commissioned the Review of Food Labelling Law and Policy as part of the COAG National Seamless Economy reform agenda. In early 2011 an independent review panel, chaired by Dr Neal Blewett AC, completed <em>Labelling Logic: Review of Food Labelling Law and Policy</em> (2011) and presented 61 recommendations for consideration by the Ministerial Council. The 61 recommendations spanned a number of themes, including the policy drivers for food labelling; principles and criteria to guide government decision making on regulatory intervention, public health and safety, new technologies, consumer value issues, and compliance and enforcement.</p>
<p>The Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation (convening as the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council, and hereafter referred to as 'the FoFR') responded to the review on 9 December 2011, accepting the majority of the recommendations.</p>
<p>The government's response proposed, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>that work begin with the food industry and public health groups to develop a single front-of-pack labelling model that will assist Australian shoppers when they make choices about the food they buy</li>
<li>that standards for nutrition and health claims on food labels (such as 'low fat', 'high in fibre', etc) be improved to ensure the labels reflect public health goals and provide meaningful information to consumers</li>
<li>further advice be sought regarding labelling to provide consumers with better information about added sugars, fats and vegetable oils and</li>
<li>pregnancy warning labels on alcohol be mandated within two years noting the current industry initiatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The FoFR has considered the role and purpose of food labels now and into the future. In developing a response and proposed plan of action to the recommendations, the FoFR considered the terms of reference for the review, the COAG reform agenda and outcomes being sought by the recommendations.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has agreed to lead the development of a National Nutrition Policy that is anticipated to provide an overarching framework to identify, prioritise, drive and monitor nutrition initiatives within the context of the governments' preventive health agendas.</p>
<p>A National Nutrition Policy may consider a range of strategies such as defining how food labels should be used to contribute to preventive health objectives, and how issues such as vulnerable groups and Indigenous nutrition can be better addressed.</p>
<p>The Strategy Group values the importance of the system to maintain its clean, green and safe image but feels the label is being overused as a mechanism to achieve health outcomes with an increased regulatory cost to the industry.</p>
<h5>Programs</h5>
<p>While it has been noted, that some programs are best pitched at a local level (due to scale), there still remains a need for greater communication at the Commonwealth, State and Territory level to ensure programs are not duplicated unnecessarily. At present there are five programs at the Commonwealth and State Government level (Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia, Northern Territory) which aim to assist Australian SMEs to enter and develop export markets. Funding arrangements for the most part are almost identical for each program and reimburse up to 50 per cent of eligible promotion activities (including market research, trade show attendance costs, website development etc). While it cannot be argued that these programs do not provide benefit to industry, greater communication, coordination and integration, especially at the design stage of the programs, would ensure greater efficiency and potentially improved scale.</p>
<h4 id="h4_45">4.3.4 Competition for skilled/unskilled workers is high especially in low unemployment</h4>
<p>A number of factors have combined to make it difficult for agricultural businesses to find and retain skilled labour. These include 'strong economic growth, the boom in well-paid jobs in the resources sector, and an ageing population'.<sup><a href="#fn_219" id="fnr_219">219</a></sup> Training is the responsibility of both government and companies. While it is difficult to quantify the amount that companies are investing in training their workforce, in challenging trading conditions some Strategy Group members have suggested that training budgets are seen by some firms as peripheral to core business.</p>
<p>According to the 92 respondents in the PwC industry survey, businesses are finding it extremely difficult to attract staff. Engineers appeared to be in particularly short demand, with 53 businesses claiming that they were difficult to attract. Seniority did not appear to play a strong role, however, as businesses claimed it was just as hard to attract plant maintenance workers (46 businesses) as managers (46 businesses).</p>
<p>Half of all businesses surveyed claimed that up to a quarter of their employees were engaged on a casual basis and this was more likely to be the case among businesses within the meat and fruit/vegetable industries. Twenty-nine businesses claimed that up to 25 per cent of their employees were shift workers, a further fifth of businesses claimed shift workers made up between 26-50 per cent of their workforce.</p>
<p>From 1978 until 2010, Australia's unemployment rate averaged 7.11 per cent reaching an historical high of 10.9 per cent in December of 1992 and a record low of 4.0 per cent in February of 2008. The unemployment rate in Australia was reported as 5.1 percent in January 2012.</p>
<p>The current low levels of unemployment and the competition for skilled and unskilled workers, described above, are exacerbated by the demands of the mining sector, which are impacting the food processing sector, particularly in rural and regional areas. It has also been alleged that for some time the food processing industry has suffered unfairly from an image problem, making it even harder to attract workers.</p>
<p>The difficulty in attracting employees appears to have driven some businesses in the food processing industry to recruit staff from overseas. Twenty-nine out of 92 businesses contacted as a result of the PwC industry survey said they were doing this to some degree although the numbers were small. Those most likely to sponsor employees were medium to large in size.</p>
<p>The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) provides 457 visas for short-term workers. Industry has voiced concerns that the process for allocation of these visas is very slow. Some processors and manufacturers are now using foreign language students.</p>
<p>Recently, the Government announced a doubling of the period of time a skilled worker can stay in Australia to work for accredited businesses; there will also be priority processing for applications for certain employers under changes to the 457 visa system.</p>
<p>The changes, which came into effect on 7 November 2011, will allow the accredited businesses to bring in skilled workers for six years rather than three and also have priority processing for all future visa applications.</p>
<p>In order to become accredited, a business must have been an active 457 visa sponsor over the past three years, employing at least 30 overseas workers over the past 12 months, and guarantee that their local workforce is at least 75 per cent Australian.</p>
<p>Average processing time for 457 visa applications is 22 days, although DIAC aims to reduce processing time for 457 visas to within ten days.</p>
<h4 id="h4_46">4.3.5 Declining numbers of food scientists, food technologists and trained staff</h4>
<p>Contemporary reports claim that 'formal training in agriculture and food production appears to be in decline',<sup><a href="#fn_220" id="fnr_220">220</a></sup> with falling enrolments in agriculture and related agricultural sciences. This observed decline raises concerns about the future availability of qualified agricultural scientists and skilled farm labour.</p>
<p>As outlined in <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> , one of the tangible shifts in the sector in recent years has been a decline in the number of student enrolments and completions in the food sciences since 2004, while the number of student enrolments and completions in nutrition-related courses has been significantly increasing for the past few years.</p>
<p>It appears that fewer students enrolled to study the food sciences and that fewer completed their courses, while more students were enrolling in nutrition-related courses. As a consequence of reduced student numbers and the low level of R&amp;D funding available for food science compared with other areas that universities operate in, there has been an erosion of food science capability within universities.</p>
<p>There appears to be a gap in meeting the food safety skills needs of food processing in SMEs. Suitable food safety training that can be delivered in ways that reach staff in their place of business, including regional locations, need to be developed. Unfortunately, some businesses are not aware that they have potential food safety problems. In these cases regulators can also provide valuable links to enable necessary skills development'.<sup><a href="#fn_221" id="fnr_221">221</a></sup></p>
<p>AgriFood Skills Australia<sup><a href="#fn_222" id="fnr_222">222</a></sup> believes that serious labour shortages in the agrifood industry pose fundamental food security challenges for Australia. In particular, the current very low number of agrifood students training in the VET system, relative to other industries, makes it unlikely that future industry labour needs will be able to be met.</p>
<p>In addition, the Strategy Group was told that food industry was not regarded as exciting enough to school leavers, who are unaware of the supply chain and how food is developed from 'paddock to plate'. Some Strategy Group members claimed that existing courses did not deliver the right balance of skills and the curricula did not reflect industry needs. Some courses were thought to be too academically focused with few practical subjects.</p>
<h4 id="h4_47">4.3.6 Vast majority of food companies are small</h4>
<p>The vast majority of food businesses are small (less than 20 staff). When scale is small, competiveness is hard to achieve, particularly as the major retailers reduce the variety of products on their shelf in each category. 'Limited firm resources and international contacts as well as lack of requisite managerial knowledge about internationalisation have remained critical constraints to SME internationalisation. These resource limitations, especially of a financial kind, seem particularly prevalent among smaller, newly internationalising [SMEs]. SMEs from particular sectors and regions also appear to face particular international barriers.'<sup><a href="#fn_223" id="fnr_223">223</a></sup></p>
<p>Small businesses also have fewer funds to invest in innovation, and pilot equipment is expensive to access. Between 2005 and 2010 the R&amp;D Expenditure on Food Product Manufacturing by businesses with 0-4 employees decreased significantly, by approximately 28.1 per cent, while businesses with 5-19, 20-199 and 200 or more employees increased by 107.3 per cent, 55.9 per cent and 36.8 per cent respectively.<sup><a href="#fn_224" id="fnr_224">224</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the 92 respondents to the PwC industry survey, while the majority of businesses surveyed were engaged in R&amp;D, the investment was relatively low, with 69 businesses investing fewer than 5 per cent of their total costs on R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, according to a CSIRO survey, there appears to be a lack of knowledge by industry about where pockets of research excellence are located and how to access them.<sup><a href="#fn_225" id="fnr_225">225</a></sup></p>
<p>Consequent to the food SME technology transfer pilot program (FoodTech), which was led by CSIRO and independently evaluated by a business called Clear Horizon in 2008, it was found that there was a need for technology transfer mechanisms to engage a broad set of stakeholders across sectors and industry segments in order to develop R&amp;D and Technology Transfer priorities and capability plans for the food industry as a whole. Capacity and capability were found to be factors in small to medium companies' desire to innovate.</p>

<h4 id="h4_48">4.4.1 Thirty-two per cent increase in world population by 2050</h4>
<p>Global demand for food is set to double by 2050. The Australian food sector is well placed to take advantage of this demand, especially in growing Asian markets where population growth is often accompanied by growth in incomes. Supporting Australia's food and grocery sector to develop new technologies, processes and investment was seen by the Strategy Group as an opportunity to help the industry grow.</p>
<p>'Global food security will demand the development and delivery of new technologies to increase food production on limited arable land and without relying on increased water and fertiliser use. In addition, the frequency and severity of climate 'shocks' are expected to increase due to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>'Australia can make a significant contribution to addressing this challenge. We have extensive experience in dealing with difficult and low input food production systems. This technical and scientific expertise is valuable and well-regarded internationally. However, success in technology development and delivery requires community support. Although agriculture is one of our most productive and efficient industries it struggles to garner community support. The decline in knowledge and interest in food production has resulted in part from the urbanisation of the Australian population. This decline risks limiting industry's ability to deliver innovation to the Australian and international food industries'<sup><a href="#fn_226" id="fnr_226">226</a></sup>.</p>
<h4 id="h4_49">4.4.2 Increasing middle class in countries close to Australia will desire safe, quality, convenient and protein-based foods</h4>
<p>Emerging markets present opportunities for growth. The demand for high-value-added convenient foods will be one such opportunity, and supplying the demands of affluent consumers in Asia for more protein-rich diets is another. By 2020, the Asia-Pacific region could have more people in its middle class than the rest of the world combined. China could have a middle-class market that surpasses the United States in dollar terms. The continued rise of middle-class incomes in Asia presents Australia's food export industries with increased opportunities, as the demand for value-added products will rise.<sup><a href="#fn_227" id="fnr_227">227</a></sup></p>
<p>Australia's claim for a greater share of the Asian markets will depend on the food processing industry's capacity to increase its competitiveness and productivity. Australian companies have already proven their abilities in the past by gaining worldwide recognition for innovations in food processing. Successful businesses innovate. Innovation results in growth.</p>
<p>The strategy of some foreign-owned companies is to manufacture as close as possible to, or inside, the markets they supply. As a result Australia's proximity to Asia is both an opportunity and a threat. Australian firms are required to comply with tariffs and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) whereas some of their competitors receive high levels of protection from their own governments (see <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> ).</p>
<p>As outlined in <a href="#h2_9"><strong>Chapter Two</strong></a>, Japan remains Australia's largest food export market with approximately 17 per cent market value share in 2009-10. Indonesia has become an important export market with 8.5 per cent of the total value of food exports in 2009-10, which equates to a fourfold increase since 1990-91. Other Asian markets such as China, Thailand and the Philippines have also become more predominant importers. The share of exports going to the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong has increased over the period.</p>
<p>The ASEAN group countries (Burma, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) are rapidly growing in importance as destinations for Australian food exports, although a slight decline in the value share occurred in 2009-10 (down to 20 per cent).<sup><a href="#fn_228" id="fnr_228">228</a></sup></p>
<p>The food industry has been resilient throughout the economic slowdown compared to other industries due to strong growth fundamentals. Going forward, the industry is expected to continue growing, mainly driven by the Asian economies and their large populations and rising per capita income.</p>
<h4 id="h4_50">4.4.3 Lifestyle trends - convenient and tasty, healthy and sustainable options</h4>
<p>Food choices are based on a complex range of drivers including convenience, health and wellness, pleasure and price. Add to this the desire for authenticity, longer shelf-life, sustainability and ethical production that have emerged as trends not only in Australia but with the rising middle classes in Asia.</p>
<p>Australian consumers are searching to define their personal eating styles through revising their thinking about food, and mixing and matching various food characteristics to find the ideal combinations for themselves and their families. The food value chain is strongly driven by consumer demands. Consumer trends and drivers that are likely to shape the future food value chain include:</p>
<ul>
<li>consumers are dissatisfied with their current shopping environments</li>
<li>a rapid growth of online shopping</li>
<li>sustainability and other environmental issues increasingly influence shopping behaviour</li>
<li>consumers want personalised food product offerings and</li>
<li>health and wellness is a growing factor in consumer buying decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2008, the Deloitte survey<sup><a href="#fn_229" id="fnr_229">229</a></sup> of 93 top businesses executives identified the following as the key consumer trends shaping the industry:</p>
<ul>
<li>convenience - 66 per cent</li>
<li>'premium-isation' - 48 per cent</li>
<li>more out-of-home consumption - 36 per cent</li>
<li>choice/selection - 23 per cent</li>
<li>freshness - 21 per cent</li>
<li>shopping experience - 20 per cent</li>
<li>prepared food - 14 per cent, and</li>
<li>regional pride/nationalism - 11 per cent.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the PwC Australian food and beverage businesses industry survey, 11 of 92 surveyed businesses said that customer pressure on costs and the price expectations of customers were the biggest challenge facing their business. However, high levels of new product development (particularly for retail) and product renewal (particularly for health eating) with good return on investment, reasonable success rates and good levels of revenue provided for significant future opportunities.</p>
<p>Internationally, consumers are increasingly gaining influence and effectively getting their voices heard across the global supply chain. Food manufacturers agree consumers are becoming more empowered and commanding greater influence across the supply chain.</p>
<p>Manufacturers express a strong degree of confidence in consumers regarding the value of their endorsements. They consider claims made by consumers the single most valuable type of endorsement, which serves as another proof point of the growing influence of consumers. Demonstrating confidence in their own performance, food manufacturers rank their own endorsements as the next most valuable type of claim.<sup><a href="#fn_230" id="fnr_230">230</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="h4_51">4.4.4 Reduction in post-harvest wastage</h4>
<p>As outlined in <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> , waste occurs at different points in the food supply chain, although it is most readily defined at the retail and consumer stages, where outputs of the agricultural system are self-evidently 'food' for human consumption.</p>
<p>The post-harvest sector includes all points in the value chain from production in the field to the food being placed on a plate for consumption. Post-harvest activities include harvesting, handling, storage, processing, packaging, transport and marketing. Losses can be caused by a wide variety of factors, ranging from growing conditions to handling at retail level. In some cases everything harvested by a farmer may end up being sold to consumers. In others, losses or waste may be considerable. Occasionally, losses may be 100 per cent.</p>
<p>In the PwC industry survey 92 businesses were asked whether waste management was critical to the commercial, strategic or economic interests of the business. For 39 businesses in this survey, waste management was reported as critical for commercial, strategic and economic interests. The main contributing source factors to wastage included short shelf-life (15 businesses), poor process control (13 businesses) and poor quality of materials (12 businesses). A key observation was that businesses within the dairy, grain/cereal and bakery industries were more likely to claim short shelf-life as the source producing the highest level of waste within the business.</p>
<p>After identifying the sources of waste, businesses were then asked to demonstrate what measures had been taken to address the waste produced. Sixty-nine businesses had taken some form of action to reduce waste production. A significant proportion of those respondents (48) had changed their manufacturing or processing method to overcome issues with waste management. Another popular option for businesses to address waste production was to reuse or recycle waste products (33 businesses). Finally, approximately a quarter of respondents had sourced better-quality materials (25 businesses) - these respondents were more likely to be businesses within the meat, oil/fat, grain/cereal and beverage industries.</p>
<p>Considering that raw materials are the greatest input cost for manufacturers, consideration should be given to research on mechanisms to improve consistency of ingredients via improving process control, and improving shelf-life.</p>
<h3 id="h3_28">4.5 Threats</h3>
<h4 id="h4_52">4.5.1 Market structure - supermarket duopoly</h4>
<h5>Australia's competition framework</h5>
<p>The Australian Government's principal framework to promote competition in the Australian economy is the <em>Competition and Consumer Act 2010</em> (CCA, formerly known as the <em>Trade Practices Act 1974</em>).</p>
<p>The CCA prohibits a number of anti-competitive practices. For example, section 46 of the CCA prohibits a corporation with a substantial degree of market power from taking advantage of that market power for an anti-competitive purpose. Broadly, that anti-competitive purpose is to either substantially damage or eliminate competitors or prevent others from engaging in competitive conduct. Other provisions of the CCA are designed to prohibit large businesses from engaging in unfair businesses practices when dealing with smaller businesses. In particular, the CCA prohibits corporations from engaging in unconscionable conduct in their dealings with other businesses. Relevant to whether a corporation has engaged in unconscionable conduct are considerations such as whether the corporation has acted in good faith in its dealings with another business, and the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the supplier and the corporation.</p>
<p>In 2006 the Federal Government introduced a mandatory code of conduct for the horticulture sector, which came into effect in May 2007. This Code excludes a number of prominent agents involved in broader fruit and vegetable activities, like retailers and exporters. The implementation of this regulation has improved transparency in wholesale margins and allowed for more appropriate price setting.</p>
<p>The Australian Government also funds the Produce and Grocery Industry Ombudsman which can assist with disputes under the <em>voluntary</em> Produce and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct (PGICC).</p>
<h5>Healthy competition</h5>
<p>While competition is a complex issue, healthy competition provides the foundation for an internationally competitive economy and can be the catalyst to better business management, improved productivity and access to greater business opportunities. Australian consumers also benefit from lower prices and greater choice when there is strong, genuine competition between businesses.</p>
<p>In a perfectly competitive market, price pressures should flow through the supply chain to cause all participants (retailers, manufacturers, farmers and other suppliers) to seek productivity and quality improvements.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for countries like Australia (small population - large landmass) to have duopolies and oligopolies across a broad range of industries. As described in <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> , there is concentration in the Australian retail food market. This can improve retailers' selling power to the consumer. This can also improve the buying power of the retailers, and the Strategy Group argues that such an outcome may disadvantage suppliers and consumers in the long run.</p>
<p>The numerous enquiries into the retail sector in recent years - ACCC and Senate - have all concluded that there is an acceptable level of competition within the sector. However, industry feedback suggests that those studies lacked sufficient input from manufacturers, the latter fearful of the potential consequences of raising their issues and concerns in a public or private context.</p>
<h5>Real lower prices?</h5>
<p>Ostensibly the main dividend of good competition is cheaper prices to consumers. The Australian consumer price index for food (excluding alcoholic beverages) increased by 3.7 per cent in 2010-11. This was close to its average of 3.9 per cent for the 10 years to 2009-10, although it should be noted that food prices in 2010-11 were affected by adverse weather conditions at that time.<sup><a href="#fn_231" id="fnr_231">231</a></sup> The conclusions of Choice in 2009 were that:</p>
<ul>

<h5>Allegations brought about buying power</h5>
<p>The Strategy Group identified the problems associated with dealing with the consequences of the duopoly in the retail world and the competition with home brand products (see <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> ) as a major factor holding the development of the industry back.</p>
<p>In the PwC industry survey, the dominance of the two major retailers and global competition were by far the biggest challenges faced by business according to 25 respondents (32 per cent of non exporters and 27 per cent of exporters). Businesses within the meat, fruit and vegetable and sugar/confectionary industries were more likely to be affected by the actions of the large grocery retailers. Some respondents indicated that the relationship between them and the retailers had deteriorated significantly in the past few years, especially in the last nine months, and that it was now characterised by mutual distrust and a lack of partnership.</p>
<p>The issue of alleged abuse of market power by the major retailers was raised on numerous occasions during consultations conducted by DIISRTE and by DAFF around the National Food Plan. Fear of a possible loss of livelihood if producers and processors do not comply with the dictates of the duopoly was expressed by a number of producers.</p>
<p>In recent times concerns have been raised about retailers making retrospective adjustments to terms and conditions of supply, and suppliers being liable for losses due to shrinkage. The AFGC<sup><a href="#fn_233" id="fnr_233">233</a></sup> has claimed that the retailers' buyer power is threatening the long-term viability of suppliers by driving down prices, and that some of the weaker suppliers will be driven out of the market by the retailers. As discussed in <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> , the growth of 'private labels' also appears to be adding to the problems. Some manufacturers believe that the behaviours of the retailers are impacting on their access to market, their margins and their ability to invest in capital improvements and innovation.</p>
<p>Some retailers have been accused of behaviours bordering on unconscionable conduct and misuse of market power. The new head of the ACCC has promised that he will look closely at the activities of the retail sector, particularly as to how it relates to suppliers.</p>
<h5>Shifting profits</h5>
<p>The distribution of profits along the food chain provides an insight into where productivity improvements can be made. The major retailers may be achieving increased profits while containing food prices (or only slightly increasing food prices above CPI) by extracting profits from suppliers rather than seeking internal productivity improvements. <strong><a href="#tbl_4-3">Table 4.3</a></strong> below not only shows the rapid growth in net operating profit of Woolworths and Coles, but also their other operating revenue (e.g. rebates, discounts received and other) obtained from their suppliers. For those years with available data, rebates and discounts constituted a significant proportion of the retailers' profits. This compares to relative flat-lining of manufacturers profits over the past ten years (see <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> ).</p>

<h5>Why aren't suppliers using the current legal mechanisms?</h5>
<p>Fear of retribution may mean that even if a case for unconscionable conduct can be made, suppliers may be reluctant to bring forward complaints and be a party to any legal action. The cost, financial and time, especially for SME suppliers, is also a significant disincentive to explore this avenue. Notwithstanding the ACCC's capacity to take evidence in confidence, potential retributive action on the part of retailers, should there be a leak of confidential information, might include restricting access to market, cancellation of contracts, a reduction in the quality of trading terms, and failure to promote a supplier's product adequately, e.g. a non-optimum shelf position. Given the retailers' market share these issues can have a significant impact on any business. For this reason there may be a need for market intervention.</p>
<h5>Possible ways forward</h5>
<p>The long-term prognosis of continued, unmitigated retail concentration for local food and beverage manufacturing, jobs, product diversity, healthy competition and ultimately, prices paid by consumers, is unclear.</p>
<p>There have been developments in a number of overseas jurisdictions related to mandatory retail codes of conduct. A Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP) was recently introduced in the United Kingdom (UK). The UK's concentration of retailers is less than that of Australia. The GSCOP came into force in February 2010 and was introduced to address the UK Competition Commission's concerns that grocery retailers were adopting certain practices that transferred excessive risks and unexpected costs to suppliers. The British Government intends to introduce a bill in 2012 to create a Groceries Code Adjudicator. The European Union is considering a voluntary code of conduct that specifies unwanted behaviours.</p>
<p>The ACCC, once it has considered whether there has been any misuse of market power or unconscionable conduct, will be able to provide advice on the necessity of a mandatory code or any other changes to legislation to improve competition.</p>
<p>The Strategy Group believes it is important to have low barriers to entry in the retail environment to allow new entrants. While the Strategy Group has no particular suggestions to do this it notes the developments outlined in <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> with respect to planning and zoning. This would create greater competition in the retail part of the chain providing more avenues, in addition to the export market, for manufacturers to sell their products.</p>
<h4 id="h4_53">4.5.2 Sustained high Australian dollar</h4>
<p>In recent years, an increase in demand for Australian currency associated with trade and financial flows has resulted in an appreciation of the Australian dollar. This increase in demand for Australian dollars has resulted in a higher 'price' of the currency or an appreciation of the exchange rate (see <a href="#h2_9"><strong>Chapter Two</strong></a>).</p>
<p>To a large extent, the strength of the Australian dollar has resulted from the resources boom, high commodity prices and high interest rates due to a growing economy. This has contributed to competition from cheap imports, and confirms the view of Australian firms surveyed in 2000 that 'import penetration could increase'.</p>
<p>In the PwC industry survey, the strong Australian dollar was cited as a major reason why cheaper products were being sourced from overseas. As the Treasury<sup><a href="#fn_235" id="fnr_235">235</a></sup> noted in its submission to the Senate inquiry into the processed food industry, the value of Australia's processed food exports declined to $16.8 billion in 2009-10, $1.7 billion lower than in 2008-09. The appreciation of the Australian dollar was a key factor that would have accounted for much of this decline.<sup><a href="#fn_236" id="fnr_236">236</a></sup> However, growth in the value of processed food imports also appears to have flattened.</p>
<p>According to the Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC) 'the high Australian dollar is making imported food and grocery products cheaper making it harder for Australian-made products to compete on Australian supermarket shelves'.<sup><a href="#fn_237" id="fnr_237">237</a></sup></p>
<p>The cost of doing business is high in Australia and there is a lack of scale of facilities and output - so when exchange rates fluctuate or become unfavourable for a sustained period of time, the competitiveness of the sector is threatened.</p>
<h4 id="h4_54">4.5.3 Climate change</h4>
<p>According to the World Economic Forum,<sup><a href="#fn_238" id="fnr_238">238</a></sup> one of the three clusters of risks to watch is the 'water-food-energy' nexus: 'A rapidly rising global population and growing prosperity are putting unsustainable pressures on resources. Demand for water, food and energy is expected to rise by 30 to 50 per cent in the next two decades, while economic disparities incentivize short-term responses in production and consumption that undermine long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>'Shortages could cause social and political instability, geopolitical conflict and irreparable environmental damage. Any strategy that focuses on one part of the water-food-energy nexus without considering its interconnections risks serious unintended consequences.</p>
<p>'Agriculture is the dominant water user, consuming more than 70 per cent of total global water demand. Industrially produced meat is especially water-intensive, requiring up to 20,000 litres of water to produce a kilogram, compared to approximately 1200 litres to produce a kilogram of grain. Both population growth and increasing meat consumption in emerging economies will therefore have a tremendous impact on resource needs'.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Garnaut Review report predicts that the impact of climate change will be severe if no effective mitigation occurs. It is likely to place stresses on water supplies and, together with changes in temperature, will have a major effect on agriculture.</p>
<p>'By mid-century, there would be major declines in agricultural production across much of the country. Irrigated agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin would be likely to lose half of its annual output. This would lead to changes in our capacity to export food and a growing reliance on food imports, with associated shifts from export parity to import parity pricing ... By the close of the century, the impacts of a no-mitigation case can be expected to be profound. The increased frequency of drought, combined with decreased median rainfall and a nearly complete absence of runoff in the Murray-Darling Basin, is likely to have ended irrigated agriculture for this region. Depopulation will be under way ... Much coastal infrastructure along the early 21st century lines of settlement is likely to be at high risk of damage from storms and flooding'.<sup><a href="#fn_239" id="fnr_239">239</a></sup></p>
<p>Numerous submissions to the National Food Plan identified agricultural water and climate change as important matters likely to affect the food processing sector in Australia. Fonterra Australia Pty Ltd noted that climate change required the capacity of the food industry to be developed through climate awareness training in areas such as water efficiency, risk management tools and financial support.</p>
<p>Many large food manufacturers are working to improve their water efficiency. However, in most cases this is driven by rising energy costs which can be significantly reduced by improving water efficiency due to the large energy costs of water heating and waste-water treatment. Sara Lee's large bakery facility at Lisarow in NSW has implemented major water savings using biological waste-water treatment and improved water flow management, enabling the business to save approximately $1 million annually in trade waste-water costs.<sup><a href="#fn_240" id="fnr_240">240</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="h4_55">4.5.4 Increasing energy costs</h4>
<p>The fact that food is a perishable item - there are long freight distances and cold chain practices in Australia - means that the energy costs associated with food processing can be high. Refrigeration represents the biggest energy use for most food and beverage industry businesses - from abattoirs to bakeries, cold stores, dairy processors and food, beverage and pet food manufacturers.</p>
<p>A number of submissions to the Senate Select Committee on the Australian Food Processing Sector, such as the Australian Meat Industry Council and Growcom (Queensland horticultural association) cited increasing energy costs as a factor likely to impact their businesses. In addition, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association noted that there seems little doubt that the cost of a price on carbon emissions will also overlay the cost of energy-intensive inputs - especially electricity at farm and in processing.</p>
<p>Some submissions to the National Food Plan linked food security and climate change to increasing energy costs. As Growcom pointed out, 'at some point in time the supply of oil will plateau and begin to fall (so called "peak oil"). The resulting decrease in energy availability and rapid increase in cost will have far-reaching effects on agricultural production and the wider economy'. <sup><a href="#fn_241" id="fnr_241">241</a></sup></p>
<p>In the PwC industry survey, 57 businesses indicated that they had energy-efficiency plans in which they were investing, or were intending to invest. An example, the Tamburlaine Winery in the Hunter Valley, has slashed its power use by half by doing some simple things such as running time and thermostat controls, upgrading heat exchangers and making pipe-work modifications, reducing overall electricity use by 48 per cent and refrigeration energy use by 54 per cent. <sup><a href="#fn_242" id="fnr_242">242</a></sup></p>
<p>The Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program is a central element of the Australian Government's Clean Energy Future plan announced in July 2011. The Clean Energy Future plan provides transitional assistance for businesses and industry through the $8.6 billion Jobs and Competitiveness Program, the $1.2 billion Clean Technology Program, the $300 million Steel Transformation Plan and the $1.3 billion Coal Sector Jobs Package.</p>
<p>The Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program is a $200 million competitive, merit-based grants program to support Australian food and foundry manufacturers to maintain competitiveness in a carbon-constrained economy. This program will provide grants for investments in energy efficient capital equipment and low-pollution technologies, processes and products.</p>
<p>The Strategy Group received some evidence that retailers are unlikely to pass the costs of the carbon tax on to the consumer. As a result the food processors may be required to bear the costs which they have incurred and those that have been passed onto them from the packaging and transport industries. In addition, increased fuel costs are likely to affect all areas of the supply chain from farm equipment to transport.</p>
<h4 id="h4_56">4.5.5 Barriers to export trade, including 'behind the border' barriers</h4>
<p>Most processed foods are traded internationally by large multinational companies. The largest food manufacturing companies such as Nestle and Kraft operate in over 140 countries to take advantage of domestic market opportunities and to circumnavigate barriers to trade.<sup><a href="#fn_243" id="fnr_243">243</a></sup></p>
<p>Australia's processed food sector is characterised by a strong presence of such companies which are responsible for a significant proportion of the value generated in the sector. However, there are also approximately 12 500 small to medium enterprises operating in the Australian processed food sector (ABS).</p>
<p>Australia is an open economy, with the import and export sectors comprising 40 per cent of Gross Domestic Product<sup><a href="#fn_244" id="fnr_244">244</a></sup>. Australia is one of the countries that have benefitted most from rising international trade, importing goods more cheaply than they could be made in Australia and selling exports that commanded rising prices because they were in international demand.</p>
<p>In the PwC industry survey, three in every four businesses of the 92 surveyed said they exported their products, although this was a small volume of their business (50 businesses claimed only 1 to 10 per cent of their sales). As mentioned in <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> , a recurring comment made by food processors was that DAFF Biosecurity fees had significantly increased in recent years, and that this was placing pressure on exporters. Respondents said that meat export licences fees had increased from $2000 to $14 000 per annum in the last few years. Despite Australian products costing up to 40 per cent more than competitive products from Asia and Europe, sales growth had been good in Asia and the Indian Ocean Islands, especially from the food service industry.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is pursuing bilateral and regional trade agreements which are likely to afford significant net economic benefits and are more cost-effective than other options for reducing trade and investment barriers, including alternative forms of bilateral and regional action. In its trade negotiations the Government is seeking to reduce foreign tariff barriers and quantitative restrictions on Australian exports of primary commodities and manufactured goods.<sup><a href="#fn_245" id="fnr_245">245</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, other countries have been lowering their trade barriers at the same time as Australia, increasing the overall gains from trade liberalisation by improving market access for Australian exporters. Among Australia's major trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region, which buy 70 per cent of Australia's exports, average tariffs on all goods have been cut over the last quarter century from more than 25 per cent to around 5 per cent.<sup><a href="#fn_246" id="fnr_246">246</a></sup> However, agricultural trade remains distorted with average applied tariffs for agriculture being high in many countries including 13.5 per cent for the EU, 21 per cent for Japan, 10.7 per cent for Canada, 48.6 per cent for Korea, and there are 'behind the border' barriers in place due to differing regulatory systems.</p>
<p>Australia could provide policy assistance in neighbouring countries to help them develop appropriate regulatory systems including for GMO foods.</p>
<h4 id="h4_57">4.5.6 Access to capital</h4>
<p>The availability of finance on reasonable terms allows businesses to expand their activities, fund new and innovative investments, smooth cash flows and maintain employment. Access to finance is critical for businesses to fund investment; however, capital is not easy to access from banks.</p>
<p>A number of studies using firm-level survey data has shown that small- and medium-sized businesses (employing less than 200 employees) not only perceive access to finance and the cost of credit to be greater obstacles than larger businesses, but these factors constrain small and medium businesses more than large businesses. This is particularly important in the processed food industry where almost 99 per cent of businesses are small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>In the report <em>Exporting Australian Processed Foods: Are We Competitive?</em>,<sup><a href="#fn_247" id="fnr_247">247</a></sup> 45 per cent of survey respondents identified insufficient financial resources as a domestic cost inhibiting exports. This view is confirmed by more recent data provided by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) Global Readiness index,<sup><a href="#fn_248" id="fnr_248">248</a></sup> which concludes that access to finance remains the key constraint to the offshore expansion plans of Australian businesses. It notes that in 2009, at the height of the global financial crisis, access to finance was nominated as a barrier to expansion by 58 per cent of respondents, with 34 per cent naming it their top barrier. In 2010, with global credit conditions easing, access to finance was still the top barrier overall with 43 per cent naming it as a barrier and 26 per cent naming it their number one barrier.</p>
<p>Similarly, in 2011, the PwC industry survey found that the cost of business expansion was one of the major inhibitors in increasing investment - 44 survey respondents nominated the cost of expansion as an inhibitor to increasing investment in their business.<sup><a href="#fn_249" id="fnr_249">249</a></sup></p>
<p>Most SMEs in the manufacturing sector fund investment through debt (borrowing) or internal finance (such as retained earnings and contributions of capital by the owner). This is in contrast to large firms which seek funding primarily through external equity markets. Only a small proportion of SMEs ever undertake external equity financing, and those that do rely on working owners for any equity contributions. Compared with large companies, small businesses tend to make greater use of debt funding and less use of equity funding; the latter is generally limited to the personal capital of the owners.<sup><a href="#fn_250" id="fnr_250">250</a></sup></p>
<p>External equity finance in the form of venture capital is generally unavailable to SMEs without strong growth prospects. This includes both venture capital funds and individual private investors such as business angels.<sup><a href="#fn_251" id="fnr_251">251</a></sup>. As a result, SMEs face limited options to fund investment decisions compared to larger businesses.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of lending to small businesses is through commercial bills and other loans with variable interest rates. The remaining third of lending is at rates that are generally fixed for between one and five years.<sup><a href="#fn_252" id="fnr_252">252</a></sup></p>
<p>Lenders treat small businesses conservatively, expecting to secure loans against tangible assets, usually against residential property. This has been evident since the global financial crisis, where lending to small business has slowed, and interest margins have widened. According to the Australian Bankers' Association in its submission to the Economics Reference Committee's inquiry into access to finance by small business, this tightening of lending reflects the increase in non-performing business loans in recent years and needing to account for that increase in risk. Surveys of small businesses show that the availability and cost of finance remains a major concern.</p>
<p>According to the RBA, in the decade prior to the Global Financial Crisis, small business indicator rates generally moved in response to changes in the cash rate, which was the predominant driver of changes in funding costs. The average outstanding rate on small business loans declined, however, as there was a gradual fall in the perceived, and realised, risk of small business borrowers during this period (partly due to the increased use of residential property as security).</p>
<p>One common concern of small businesses is that interest rates on residentially secured small business loans are priced at a premium to residentially secured housing loan rates. However, according to the RBA,<sup><a href="#fn_253" id="fnr_253">253</a></sup> this pricing is a consequence of the higher expected losses on small business loans as well as the larger amount of capital that banks hold as a buffer against unexpected losses. In the first case, estimates based on past experience suggest that small business borrowers are more than twice as likely as standard mortgage customers to default and, in the event of default, a lender is likely to lose close to 30 per cent of the small business loan's value, compared to 20 per cent for housing loans.</p>
<p>As the financial crisis unfolded, the higher cost of deposits and long-term wholesale funding has seen banks' funding costs increase by more than the cash rate. There has also been an increase in the assessed riskiness of small business loans. This is consistent with the increase in non-performing small business loans, which have risen to be around 2.5 per cent of banks' total small business loan portfolios as of September 2010. This is up from a little under one per cent during 2005-07.</p>
<h4 id="h4_58">4.5.7 Fear of emerging technologies</h4>
<p>Biotechnology is becoming an increasingly important part of product development in a wide variety of industries.<sup><a href="#fn_254" id="fnr_254">254</a></sup> It is transforming agriculture and food production, providing opportunities to produce new and improved crops, food ingredients and additives with increased value and functionality.</p>
<p>The expanded use of new technologies in food processing has enormous potential for the Australian processed food businesses. For example, the use of nanotechnology to extend the shelf life of foodstuffs will potentially assist Australian food manufacturers to reduce costs directly and also through saving the embedded energy and water lost in wasted food, the latter particularly important in a carbon-inhibited economy. The use of new technologies in food processing may also enhance the product differentiation of Australian processed foods, and therefore the attractiveness and competitiveness of our food exports through shelf-life enhancements and innovation, e.g. where GM food products deliver positive health outcomes.</p>
<p>While Australia is credited with good public research facilities, fear of new technologies and concern about customer perceptions has inhibited firms from capitalising on some of these quality research outputs. This is particularly true of GM foods.</p>
<p>The Centre for International Economics report, commissioned by DIISTRE, on the Australian Food Processing Industry listed the uptake and adoption of new technologies and new capital with embodied productivity improvements as a priority area for future opportunities.<sup><a href="#fn_255" id="fnr_255">255</a></sup> There is strong incentive for Australian biotech companies to develop new strains of GM crops due to strong global demand. Australia's biotechnology industry is currently considered to be the sixth-strongest in the world.<sup><a href="#fn_256" id="fnr_256">256</a></sup></p>
<p>On 13 May 2009, the Australian Government announced a four-year National Enabling Technologies Strategy (NETS) to provide a framework for the development of enabling technologies such as biotechnology, nanotechnology and other new technologies as they emerge in Australia. A key component of the NETS is a Public Awareness and Community Engagement Program (PACE) which includes activities such as free public forums, education materials and feedback mechanisms such as regular public attitude surveys and a free call information service. The IPSOS-Eureka Social Research Institute was commissioned as part of the PACE Program to undertake research on community attitudes to biotechnology. The project took place between December 2009 and June 2010, and involved the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data.<sup><a href="#fn_257" id="fnr_257">257</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2009-10, GM food was more highly supported than foods containing preservatives and foods grown with pesticides. While 67 per cent of the public say that GM foods are acceptable, half of those opposed would change that position if there was long-term evidence of no harm being caused. About 45 per cent of those opposed to GM foods would change their position if labelling explained what ingredients had been modified and why. This support varies, depending on the amount of GM in the food, why the modification was made and whether the food was a fruit or vegetable, or other crop.</p>
<p>Attitudinal statements relating to the use of biotechnology in food and agriculture revealed that Australians hold very mixed feelings on the issue, based perhaps on a limited understanding of the science. While the majority of participants (66 per cent) expressed agreement that we should use more natural ways of farming, the majority (53 per cent) disagreed with the statement 'research and development into the genetic modification of crops should be stopped', with more than a quarter (30 per cent) disagreeing strongly.</p>
<p>In Australia, GM foods are labelled under the Food Standards Code to help consumers make an informed choice about the food they buy. They are not labelled for safety reasons, as only those GM foods assessed by FSANZ as safe are approved for sale.</p>
<p>Other technologies, such as irradiation of food and nanotechnology, can also cause concern in consumers.</p>
<p>Food irradiation is a food safety, food preservation or quarantine measure in which food is exposed to a source of ionising energy. Standard 1.5.3 - Irradiation of Food, under the FSANZ code, prohibits the irradiation of food, or ingredients or components of food, unless a specific permission is given.<sup><a href="#fn_258" id="fnr_258">258</a></sup> The specific permission may impose conditions relating to matters such as dose, packaging materials, approved premises or facilities. To date, in Australia, only herbs and spices, herbal infusions and some tropical fruits have been approved to be irradiated for the purposes of pest disinfestation and decontamination. The approval process includes consideration of the technological need for the irradiation treatment and consideration of the effects on the food composition and the nutritional impact.</p>
<p>Community concerns about irradiation centre on vitamin and amino acid depletion in the food resulting in changes in its molecular structure forming toxic chemicals linked to cancer, organ damage, genetic mutations, etc.<sup><a href="#fn_259" id="fnr_259">259</a></sup> FSANZ notes that compounds generated during the irradiation of food such as 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBS) are not unique to irradiated foods, are naturally present at low levels in some foods (e.g. cashew nuts) and are formed through other conventional processing treatments (e.g. thermal processing).<sup><a href="#fn_260" id="fnr_260">260</a></sup> In addition, community groups are concerned about the lack of labelling requirements for irradiated products in pet food, animal feed, therapeutic goods and complementary medicines since they are not classified as 'food'. In food products, the label on a package of irradiated food must include a statement to the effect that the irradiated food has been treated with ionising radiation.<sup><a href="#fn_261" id="fnr_261">261</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="h3_29">4.6 Summary</h3>
<p>Food processing is the biggest manufacturing industry in Australia in terms of employment and gross value add. It is a vital component of the economy. The industry makes a significant contribution to the economies of regional areas through employment, business and service opportunities. There are more than 12 800 small and medium enterprises in the sector and more than 222 000 people are employed in food and beverage manufacturing.</p>
<p>The Australian food processing industry faces a number of challenges and opportunities, including, the high Australian dollar; the need for productivity growth, higher input costs and the need to respond to climate change. Industry, unions, researches, academia and government need to work together to meet these challenges and harness the opportunities.</p>
<p>The recently released FOODmap<sup><a href="#fn_262" id="fnr_262">262</a></sup> analysis of the Australian food supply chain highlights some additional opportunities and challenges faced by Australia's highly competitive food market. Opportunities include emerging consumer preferences for convenience, alternative sales channels outside of the traditional retail and eating-out options, improved technologies, tailored marketing of local products and providers, and the increasing needs of the institutional food market serving the ageing, health-conscious population with an expanded range of convenient, nutritious and functional food.</p>
<p>Going forwards the impact of global economic forces on the exchange rate is likely to put further competitive pressure on the food supply chain. Competition between suppliers, food manufacturers, food retailers and foodservice operators is likely to compel all players along the food chain to streamline costs, improve the effectiveness of investment in innovation and optimise their performance by responding to consumer preferences for value, aspirations and convenience.</p>

<h2 id="h2_12">5. Recommendations</h2>

                    <p>The industry transformation strategies and recommendations for the Australian processed food industry are informed by four main themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>New markets and the Australian brand</li>
<li>Regulatory reform and program efficiencies</li>
<li>Market place relations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Strategy Group has taken the strengths of the Food Processing Industry to maximise the opportunities identified in <a href="#h2_11"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></a>. It has also attempted to mitigate some of the threats and weaknesses with appropriate strategies.</p>
<p>This chapter will outline the key recommendations from the Strategy Group, including options, where appropriate, as well as the rationale underpinning the recommendations. Collectively these themes and recommendations provide a framework to deliver on the vision of the Food Processing Industry Strategy Group for the industry to 2020 and beyond: 'An innovative, growing, sustainable, responsive and globally competitive Australian food processing sector'.</p>
<h3 id="h3_30">5.1 Innovation</h3>
<div>
  <h4>Recommendation 1</h4>
  <p>Industry, governments, research institutes and universities collaborate to create a Food Innovation Hub/Network, incorporating a strategic planning and intelligence function, and a virtual network</p>
</div>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>As outlined in <a href="#h2_11"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></a>, collaboration between public research institutions, government support services and Australian processed food manufacturing business could be more strategic, commercially targeted and coordinated. There could be engagement with a greater percentage of the sector and the translation of its business problems into coherent, cost-effective R&amp;D projects. The current state of low R&amp;D engagement could be a key causal factor in the inconsistent and currently poor demand for government R&amp;D pilot plants around the country, despite investment by state governments and the CSIRO in those plants.</p>
<p>Innovation also needs to be nurtured in the workplace through investment in training and education. Workers and businesses benefit from the 'right environment and culture, including: mutual respect; employee/employer engagement; management and leadership skills development.</p>
<p>While 98 per cent of Australian processed food businesses are SMEs, a large share of the employment and value derived from the sector is from multinationals. Most SMEs, while innovative by nature,<sup><a href="#fn_263" id="fnr_263">263</a></sup> do not necessarily have the capacity (e.g. funds) or capability (e.g. expertise) to undertake research, nutrition and market analysis.</p>
<p>With shrinking margins, large companies, the top 50 of which produce three-quarters of the domestic industry's revenue, cannot always afford the investment to increase their capability.<sup><a href="#fn_264" id="fnr_264">264</a></sup> It is perhaps unsurprising therefore that seven out of the top ten of Australia's processed food manufacturers have moved their R&amp;D facilities to Singapore and Shanghai in recent years.</p>
<p>In addition, without heavy investment in developing insight into the needs of the Asian market, Australian businesses will miss the opportunity to properly target opportunities. Insight is a prerequisite for research and development and traditionally has been carried out independently of the product design and development process (see <strong><a href="#dig_001">Diagram 1</a></strong>). The traditional focus of product design and development does not recognise that effective innovation involves a two way flow of information with new insights coming as much from each stage of innovation and brand growth. Integration of consumer insight and market understanding with prototype products and test marketing avoids this disconnection and increases the chances of market success. There are mutual benefits for SMEs and multinationals working together, but currently opportunities for collaboration are limited.</p>
<p id="dig_001">Diagram 1 - Process of Product Design and Development<sup><a href="#fn_265" id="fnr_265">265</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="./images/fig_071.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the process of product design and development" />
<br/><a href="#des_51">Text description for Process of Product Design and Development</a></p>
<p>The current comparative lack of SME/multinational collaborations is due to a number of factors including: geographical spread; lack of knowledge about how to collaborate, and who with; and lack of awareness of the potential benefits of R&amp;D, reinforced in many firms by business plans that are focusing on the current state. This inhibits collaboration either between companies and researchers or between businesses. These issues are reflected in the Australia manufacturing sector's comparatively poor performance in innovation, with the proportion of large firms and SMEs with new 'to market' products well below the OECD average.<sup><a href="#fn_266" id="fnr_266">266</a></sup></p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>The Strategy Group believes the Hub/Network concept is critical to driving competitiveness, by developing greater consumer insights (both domestic and targeted at Asian markets), collaboration in R&amp;D and supply chain collaboration. There are a number of unique elements to a proposed Hub/Network including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ownership and oversight from industry, governments, researchers and universities - a 'quadripartite' partnership</li>
<li>central support systems, coordination and management (hence the term 'Hub')</li>
<li>linked infrastructure and programs (hence the term 'Network'), with physical and virtual focal points for innovation, information sharing and collaboration</li>
<li>firm-level information - geography, capability and capacity</li>
<li>improved deep insights into consumer needs and wants; the cultural context for potential export markets, global trends, and market and customer information</li>
<li>a business model that links consumer insights with product design, design development, manufacture, marketing and distribution and supply chain collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hub/Network could help link and expand the current web of capabilities spanning Australia, not all having the same range of assets, but assets applicable to the needs of the regions and targeted markets. This would include state organisations that supply innovation support to food companies (e.g. the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI), Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia (DAFWA) and Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Queensland (DAFFQ) research organisations (CSIRO, ANSTO), universities and business support suppliers (Enterprise Connect and Business Enterprise Centres).</p>
<p>The Hub/Network would require skilled management, support systems and an efficient governance framework to improve awareness of and drive increased usage by SMEs and multinationals of national and state capabilities, and to deliver on key outcomes from the Hub/Network. Performance indicators would include improved productivity, margins and exports.</p>
<p>Enterprise Connect's Food Network business experts could have a key role here as account managers, helping to develop a new improved client experience between business and science; helping to translate business problems into R&amp;D projects; and driving targeted and strategic engagement with industry, especially with SMEs that are currently not collaborating on R&amp;D, and which do not necessarily see any value in doing so.</p>
<p>The Hub/Network could provide food companies with technical expertise in new innovative product and process development, including new nutritional functionality, packaging, shelf life evaluation and market testing/consumer insight, for the domestic and Asian markets. It could help small and medium enterprises create and test new products, from concept right up to market testing.</p>
<p>The Hub/Network could develop a database of consumers available for panels to undertake market testing including those recently arrived from Asian countries.</p>
<p>The Hub/Network could include dedicated pilot plants, laboratories, test kitchens and sensory suites coordinated by experienced professionals who work with clients to develop exciting new products, solve manufacturing issues and adopt new practices for an increasingly sophisticated food and beverage market. Services could also include consultants, including those advising on innovative ICT solutions, equipment for lease, training and advisory support, and meeting facilities. The Hub/Network could also be used to identify emerging research needs of the industry that the CSIRO and the universities could undertake. A range of open and closed innovation models may be successfully employed by industry and the research community.</p>
<p>Universities and TAFEs could support and utilise Hub/Network facilities for the teaching of three key disciplines (food technology, process engineering, and marketing), to develop closer linkages with industry, and for inspiring students. A benefit is that the close proximity of teaching and industry may foster additional industry-funded scholarships and attract more students into the industry.</p>
<p>Austrade and investors (such as business angels) could be made aware of the facilities and encouraged to help drive demand and provide capacity.</p>
<p>Retailers such as Coles and Woolworths may be involved, e.g. in thematic innovation on sustainability/packaging. Packaging (paper and plastic) companies may also be engaged, focusing on opportunities for innovation in extending shelf-life; reducing energy and water use.</p>
<p>A proactive Hub/Network would also drive demand for a self-sustaining industry collaboration, improving information exchange and knowledge between firms in the food sector, retail, packaging, transport sectors and the research/academic community.</p>
<p>The Hub/Network could help provide leadership in determining future research priorities. The CSIRO has begun this process and leads a National Food and Nutrition Leaders Forum reporting to the Primary Industries Standing Committee on prioritisation of food R&amp;D.</p>
<p>More broadly, government may have a role in developing firm-level intelligence and mapping the complex and diverse processed food sector, contributing to better program design and more efficient delivery of services and supply chain collaboration.</p>
<p>The Hub/Network would produce a number of potential benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>increase the likelihood of increased overseas investment by multinationals in Australia</li>
<li>improve the level and quality of innovation by firms of all sizes, increasing both the scale and pace of national processed food innovation, and the commercialisation of that innovation</li>
<li>increase employment and competitiveness and</li>
<li>increase the supply of goods to meet the needs of the Australian market but also the growing needs of an increasing Asian middle class.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Strategy Group has not yet developed options as how this may be funded, i.e. capital and operating costs. However membership could be subscription-based, through sponsorship or fees based on use. Without some government funding the engagement of research institutes and universities may be difficult to achieve.</p>
<div>
<h4>Recommendation 2</h4>
<p>Industry to develop proposals to utilise the Australian Research Council (ARC) Competitive Grants Program, particularly Linkage Funding Schemes, the proposed Food Innovation Hub/Network, and work with universities and the VET sector to promote current R&amp;D and food industry courses.</p>
</div>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>One of the issues that might potentially inhibit the performance of innovation in Australia is the decline of skills in the food sector. The industry needs not only to 'step change' the number and quality of graduates but also change the image of the food processing industry to help attract employees to the sector.</p>
<p>Key findings from <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> regarding skills and training in the Australian food processing industry were that there has been a decline in domestic student demand for food science courses at university, despite most graduates finding employment in the food industry, albeit not necessarily in research but Q&amp;A roles. There has also been a decline in the technical science and engineering component of domestic food science university courses, to the point where industry believes many graduates are not meeting its needs. There has been a downward trend in the number of students commencing VET food processing courses over the last decade, although the number finishing has been relatively stable.</p>

<p>The number of VET-trained food processing operators may be increased over the next five years as a result of the recent Australian Government announcement of a $7.2 billion investment to support the skills system and another $1.75 billion to support major reforms to Australia's national training system, as part of the COAG agreement to the revised National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development (NASWD) and the National Partnership on Skills Reform (NP).<sup><a href="#fn_267" id="fnr_267">267</a></sup> The reforms to be delivered under the new agreement are: a national entitlement to training for working age Australians at a minimum of the first Certificate III; wider access to income-contingent loans; improved transparency through access to greater information; higher-quality training; and improved efficiency and responsiveness of the VET system.</p>
<p>As mentioned, industry needs technically capable R&amp;D professionals trained in fundamental food science. Currently the deficit in suitably qualified food scientists is being met by some food manufacturers through the employment of foreign food scientists via the 457 visa mechanism. While this approach may fill a short term need, encouragement must also be given to employers to invest in the training and skills development of their current workforce and locally available labour.</p>
<p>The need to foster close partnerships between university-based researchers and industry members could be addressed through industry involvement in collaborative research projects supported through the Australian Research Council's (ARC) Competitive Grants Program.</p>
<p>Should the food industry be successful in securing funding from the program, it will still not necessarily address the generic food scientist deficit. Where possible, however, food industry members should apply for the program to support innovation and encourage skills development in their staff and graduates.</p>
<p>Universities, too, may be reluctant to utilise the ARC Competitive Grants Program in respect of food processing research. This is because food is usually too complex, variable and heterogeneous to be the topic of publications in top journals in comparison with work on non-food model systems, so food research rarely gets funded. In the era of Excellence in Research Australia (ERA), <sup><a href="#fn_268" id="fnr_268">268</a></sup> research performance is the prime performance differentiator within and between universities, so the current limited opportunities for academics to access research funds in food processing can lead directly to a reluctance of universities to support the area of food R&amp;D. Significant co-investment by industry in university R&amp;D, however, would increase the competitiveness of applications to, for example, the ARC Linkage scheme and encourage universities to give a higher profile to food science and technology.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Australian universities are beginning to address the related training issues. For example, the University of Queensland, in collaboration with the AFGC,<sup><a href="#fn_269" id="fnr_269">269</a></sup> has established a new chair of food science and technology which is a pilot program with the potential to extend to other universities. The University of Tasmania, in collaboration with DSTO and CSIRO, is also establishing a new centre for food innovation.<sup><a href="#fn_270" id="fnr_270">270</a></sup> These developments should assist the growth of food science research and training.</p>
<p>Universities are also exploring the re-engineering of their food science degree programs, to promote increased graduate numbers through offering more pathways for students enrolled in science and engineering to focus on food science and engineering during the latter part of the degree program. These changes not only reflect current student demand trends but will also assist in addressing industry concerns about the quality, currency and relevance of Australian food science graduates. Development of collaborative university/agency arrangements that provide for placement of some of these postgraduate students with CSIRO and State Government agencies will both enhance the training of the students and increase the effectiveness of a Hub/Network.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>There needs to be a closer working relationship between the food industry and the higher education sector to promote career paths in food and food processing, and to ensure courses fulfil the training needs of industry employers.</p>
<p>One way of promoting food science research and industry career paths is by attracting university and TAFE participation in the Hub/Network. In addition to promoting employment in food manufacturing, this arrangement would cultivate collaborative training schemes with opportunities for students and industries in the form of industry internships for undergraduates and industry-supported Masters/PhD scholarships for postgraduates.</p>
<p>Many Asian food companies advertise 'food innovator' positions rather than 'food scientists', avoiding old (perhaps tired) language to describe careers in food science.</p>
<p>The Food Innovation Hub/Network could market ARC funded research and university programs related to food, to raise awareness of national food science R&amp;D and development opportunities. If food technologists and scientists see improved, higher-profile career and development opportunities, they are more likely to be inspired to choose food science as a career and/or stay in Australia. The Food Innovation Hub/Network could be used to promote the VET training system.</p>
<p>Industry careers could be promoted to science and engineering students, by internships for mid-degree applicants and scholarships for final-year graduates. The key advantages of industry-supported research scholarships are that they fund industry-relevant research and raise awareness of potential career paths in the industry, by building close ties between public research institutions and industry.</p>
<p>These strategies would help to lift the profile of Australian food science careers by countering student perceptions of low R&amp;D and low demand in the industry, and thereby assist reversal of the flow of Australian graduates into more nutrition-based and other fields or overseas.</p>
<p>The VET training system also needs to be more widely marketed and used within the food processing sector. Greater firm-level intelligence would assist the appropriate location and marketing of services. This could also facilitate the training system which is more responsive to the industry's needs. The Hub/Network could help facilitate this.</p>
<h3 id="h3_31">5.2 New Markets and the Australian Brand</h3>
<div>
<h4>Recommendation 3</h4>
<p>Government to provide assistance and information that will facilitate exports and firm-level information be used to help match businesses to export opportunities</p>
</div>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>As previous chapters have outlined, many Australian processed food businesses are suffering currently, with high input costs, the high Australian dollar, regulatory costs and declining margins. Driving demand in new markets helps to mitigate these impacts.</p>
<p>However, many Australian processed food businesses, especially SMEs, lack the capacity and capability to explore export markets. Consumer insight into Asian markets is critical to developing products that will be successful in these new markets. Access to information on Asian processed food buyers and distributors is also essential for Australian firms looking to export to those markets.</p>
<p>Austrade represents a considerable investment by the Commonwealth, e.g. employing up to 338 staff to represent the Asia network and 558 staff for the global network. However, currently those assets are underused by food manufacturers- e.g. leads on key Asian processed food buyers, current intelligence on Asian target export market regulatory regimes and scripts for businesses trying to navigate their way into those new export markets.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>While Austrade provide market information/ intelligence following the introduction of their new trade business models in October 2011, more can still be done to increase awareness of the model with the Hub/Network used to facilitate this. Enterprise Connect could resurrect and upscale its 'export ready' initiative to provide firm-level information to Austrade on which companies and subsectors are ready to engage with new Asian markets. The Hub/Network could also provide information on the different regulatory requirements of target export countries.</p>
<p>The Austrade resource, in collaboration with other export facilitation resources nationally (state-based) could be used more effectively and strategically by industry. A more targeted promotion of market intelligence to match domestic manufacturers and export market buyers is likely to prove successful. The Austrade model since its introduction to 30 June 2012, has identified 118 opportunities in the Food and Beverages sector which could be leveraged within the Hub/Network. It is too early to assess the longer term business impact of these encouraging changes. Nonetheless, the sharing of firm-based knowledge, between Enterprise Connect and Austrade and industry, for example, remains both a long term challenge as well as significant opportunity. The Food Innovation Hub/Network could also provide businesses, especially SMEs, with opportunities to collaborate with and learn from businesses that are already successfully exporting.</p>

<div>
<h4>Recommendation 4</h4>
<p>Consideration be given to regulatory clarification to define substantial transformation in relation to food products, taking into consideration consumer perceptions of meaning of the term 'Australian Made' and Australia's international obligations. Industry and Government to test the reputation of Australian food in Asian markets and investigate the most appropriate brand mark for Australian products in the various Asian markets. An Asia Pacific marketing campaign to be developed by Industry to promote Australian processed foods.</p>
</div>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Evidence suggests that 65 per cent of Australian shoppers express a strong preference for buying Australian food.<sup><a href="#fn_271" id="fnr_271">271</a></sup> However, where price is a factor this preference does not always translate into consumer's purchasing behaviour.<sup><a href="#fn_272" id="fnr_272">272</a></sup> As <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> outlined, many Australian food producers and their customers remain confused about the current rules for making country of origin claims, particularly in relation to the representation 'Made in (country)', and the interpretation of 'substantial transformation' for the food industry. This confusion is undermining the effectiveness of Australia's brand, which is based on Australia's excellent reputation for quality and food safety.</p>
<p>Country of origin labelling was considered by the review panel chaired by Dr Blewett AC and the response of the FOFR (both referred to in <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> ). FOFR asked consumer agencies to review country of origin labelling material, and, if appropriate, develop an education campaign to clarify country of origin labelling. Since the Government's response to the report, the Treasury and DIISRTE have agreed to initiate a process to examine options for improving understanding of the meanings of country of origin claims.</p>
<p>Industry is arguably not sufficiently utilising the Australian brand enough, which is a quality hallmark in Australia and , based on informal feedback, internationally. There is currently a number of certification marks intended to convey the information that goods are Australian.</p>
<p>The Australian Made Australian Grown (AMAG) logo is a certification trade mark available to food manufacturers but it is currently used by only 212 food businesses. Alternative marks are AUSBUY (marketed by the Australian Companies Institute) and OZcompliance, also licensed from private sector providers. While some of these logos are well known by the Australian consumer, we do not know how the Asian market perceives or interprets any Australian origin claims, and whether they have any marketing power.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Australian Government committed $20 million over four years to the Building Brand Australia Program, to build a national branding platform that provides an overarching, strategic approach to positioning <em>Australia</em> in the global marketplace. While this brand is not suitable to be put on products such as food as it is more of a supplier branding tool, the label could be adapted for use in this context (international marketing tool) if working in close consultation with the sector.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>Clarification for the term substantial transformation in relation to food products should be made in regulation. In developing the regulations, efforts should be made to understand what Australians think 'Made in Australia' means, as well as having regard to other international obligations. The regulations should help remove some of the confusion surrounding the term in relation to food.</p>
<p>Once regulations are in place an education campaign should be undertaken among manufacturers and then consumers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, country perceptions are becoming an increasingly important factor in competing successfully in an increasingly interconnected and global market. A strong, positive nation brand encourages people to choose Australia when they want to do business, buy products or invest.</p>
<p>Industry, including the AFGC and strategy group members, should survey Asian consumers to determine what is the most appropriate brand mark for them to relate the food to Australia, and how strong that the 'Australian brand' is in the various markets. Once completed, an Asian-Pacific marketing campaign could be developed and funded across industry and with the assistance of Austrade. The Innovation Hub/Network has a role here, both in promoting the Australian brand with Asian food processors and buyers who connect to the Hub/Network. <sup><a href="#fn_273" id="fnr_273">273</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="h3_32">5.3 Regulatory Reform and Program Efficiencies</h3>
<div>
<h4>Recommendation 5 </h4>
<p>Taking into account the analysis and recommendations from the Productivity Commission study: Performance Benchmarking of Australian and New Zealand Business Regulation: Food Safety (December 2009), the Government review regulatory arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States, in particular undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the Commonwealth taking over regulation of food processing and safety.</p>
</div>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>While Australia ranks highly on the world stage in the ease of setting up a business, there are a number of issues, related to government and industry food regulation, and the delivery of government food programs, which appear to be inefficient, and which add to industry costs or fail to enhance performance.</p>
<p>Despite efforts to encourage consistent food safety regulations across the States and Territories based on the national Food Regulation Agreement (including recommendations made by the 2008 Productivity Commission Report on Regulatory Burdens on Business: Manufacturing &amp; Distributive Trades), each state maintains different regulations, institutes separate audit processes, and has differing levels of priority and resources dedicated to enforcement. These variations impose substantial competitive disadvantages on compliant businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions, in addition to larger compliance costs for those that trade across boundaries. The 2008 Productivity Commission report recommended that unnecessary regulatory burdens that are most costly to productivity be addressed first; however, it noted that businesses are largely unable to cost separately the unnecessary parts of the regulatory burden.</p>
<p>In addition, differences of policy opinion across the various jurisdictions mean that policy development process is often unnecessarily long. Current treaty arrangements also allow New Zealand potentially and problematically to opt out of outcomes from regulatory initiatives, e.g. the mandatory fortification of flour for bread making with folic acid under Standard 2.1.1. This can result in a lower regulatory burden in New Zealand, yet products are still able to be brought into Australia from New Zealand without complying with all of the Australian laws. This provides a further potential incentive (beyond lower costs and a more favourable exchange rate) for Australian companies to relocate to New Zealand.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>There is no doubt that Australian processed food manufacturers are currently experiencing very tough trading conditions. There is evidence that poorly designed, disparate food safety regulations that do not necessarily deliver on their intended purpose and which take a significant amount of time to finalise add significantly to the costs of business. A cost-benefit analysis of current regulatory arrangements will help evaluate the current approach and any potential for efficiency gains through greater Commonwealth oversight and control of the regulation of food processing and safety.</p>
<div>
<h4>Recommendation 6</h4>
<p>Government to identify all programs at Commonwealth and state level and to identify opportunities to improve the business design of such programs to ensure that they complement each other and are delivered more efficiently.</p>
</div>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Each jurisdiction - commonwealth, states and territories, and sometimes discrete areas within a state, e.g. the Gippsland Food Plan - have their own programs and food plans which on their own may prove successful. However, often these programs lack sufficient scale. In addition, the lack of integration between these discrete programs means that there may be significant potential for duplication of effort, or conversely that good local initiatives aren't reproduced nationally.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>Governments at all levels need to work collaboratively to develop a shared understanding of the purpose of delivering particular programs, and to design opportunities that help ensure that they are delivered in the most efficient manner possible, and at a sufficient scale to ensure that they produce the best economic impact.</p>
<div>
<h4>Recommendation 7 </h4>
<p>AFGC convene a forum to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the current level of quality assurance (QA) auditing of the processed food industry and to develop recommendations on alternative QA options that reduce the regulatory burden on business - retail and manufacturing - without compromising food standards.</p>
</div>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>A number of retailing businesses and fast-food establishments have their own QA standards which they apply to suppliers e.g. BRC Global Standard, WQA Woolworths. The value of such standards is not disputed as they ensure that Australia's reputation for clean, safe food is maintained. However, given that the information sought by audits undertaken across the various standards appears to be identical by up to 80 percent, the number of audits appears to be excessive, as does the significant direct and indirect costs.</p>
<p>Food manufacturers supplying branded and private label products for the major supermarket and retail food service providers have a mandatory requirement to comply with the retailer's QA programs. These requirements involve different QA certification of state and territory food acts, but with substantial duplication (approximately 80 per cent), and also require periodic audits. Consultation with manufacturers has indicated that large manufacturers may face up to 50 QA audits per year, incurring direct costs of over $100 000 and imposing indirect costs several times higher.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>Woolworths Ltd's Head of Trade relations recently acknowledged this problem in the company's evidence to the Senate Select Committee on the Australian Processed Food Industry, and tacitly supports the recommendation: 'If there is some agency out there that can bring the various schemes together to a level that allows us to be satisfied with the outcome - that it is no less robust than the process we have in place today. We do not seek to impose any additional costs on any of our suppliers because at the end of the day it gets passed on to the consumer. We would like to be as efficient and effective as possible. I am not sure what the mechanism is to reach that point, but we would support getting to a point that is more effective and efficient than today's'.<sup><a href="#fn_274" id="fnr_274">274</a></sup></p>
<p>Industry advice is that retailer endorsement of the British Retail Consortium (BRC) food safety governance model would be a good starting point. Almost all food quality specialists in Australia would be aware of BRC. There is a great degree of crossover between all QA/food safety systems because ultimately they all converge with global best practice.</p>
<div>
<h4>Recommendation 8</h4>
<p>Governments develop a statement explaining their approach to the use of emerging raw material and process technologies in food, which supports the safe development and application of emerging technologies.</p>
</div>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>The safety of foods containing emerging technologies, such as Gene technology, irradiation and nanotechnology that have passed all current safety tests and regulations, is continually being questioned. This was most recently raised by recommendations from the Blewitt Food Labelling review, potentially jeopardising investment in one of the few technical options Australia and the world have currently to address some of the pressing future challenges and opportunities for the food sector, e.g. health problems, a burgeoning human population; peak phosphorous among others. Governments and opposition parties overseas have openly endorsed the application of emerging technologies, e.g. in the UK.<sup><a href="#fn_275" id="fnr_275">275</a></sup></p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>To seriously address the role of emerging technologies in enabling continued food security, in terms of rapid global economic and environmental change, will require a confident whole-of-government approach. The framework for establishing such a consensus already exists. As part of the National Enabling Technologies Strategy mechanisms exist in Government to respond to issues relating to emerging technologies. The Health, Safety and Environment Working Group coordinate the Australian Government's work on Enabling Technologies. In 2008, the working group developed and released the statement '<em>Australian Government Approach to the Responsible Management of Nanotechnology</em>'.</p>
<p>Emerging technologies that might improve the consistency and quality of raw material inputs, thereby reducing cost and wastage, should not be discounted because of the lack of public understanding of these technologies.</p>
<h3 id="h3_33">5.4 Marketplace Relations</h3>
<div>
<h4>Recommendation 9</h4>
<p>The food processing industry, together with the retailers, to review the effectiveness of the Produce and Grocery Industry Code of Conduct (PGICC) to see if it is fit for purpose or if an enhanced Code and/or a stronger role for an Ombudsman is required to effect behavioural change in the retail sector.</p>
</div>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>As discussed in Chapters Three and Four, the structure of the market means that retailers are able to drive a very hard bargain with their suppliers, possibly to the eventual demise of the Australian processed food sector. Manufacturers require enough profit to invest in innovation and productivity improvements. Smaller businesses currently need to seek other outlets for the sale of their goods as they find supplying to extremely large retailers challenging. While food manufacturers can consider seeking export opportunities as a relief from the difficult trading conditions, exporting too has its challenges, especially with a high Australian dollar.</p>
<p>States should continue to ensure there are low barriers to entry of retailers. Retailers should look to their own operations to gain productivity improvements, equally as hard as seeking price reductions from their suppliers. Retailers should also recognise that they need Australian manufacturers and, should economic conditions change all of a sudden, such as a large drop in the Australian dollar, imports will be more expensive, and they could turn to an Australian industry that may have disappeared.</p>
<p>The ACCC's current investigations need to play out to determine if there has been a misuse of market power and any unconscionable conduct. Australian consumers are likely to punish retailers with lower sales if retailers are found to be guilty. In the main Australians prefer Australian food - it is a brand they trust for quality and safety.</p>
<p>In the meantime, manufacturers need to deal with very powerful buyers.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>There have been calls for the Government to review the effectiveness of the PGICC, most recently through the Senate Economics References Committee report on the impacts of supermarket prices decisions on the dairy industry (2011 Dairy Report).</p>
<p>The final Government response to the 2011 Dairy Report (3 February 2012) states 'It is appropriate that industry review the effectiveness of the Code. The Government is willing to continue to engage with industry about the operation and effectiveness of the Code and would consider facilitating an industry/Government partnership to review the Code.'</p>
<p>The Chair of the Code Administration Committee (CAC) has written to the Committee to determine if there is support among its members to initiate such a review. The Strategy Group agrees with the review and agrees that ex-CAC members such as the Australian Food and Grocery Council should participate in the review. The Government should help industry facilitate the review.</p>

<p>The ACCC investigations will determine if the laws have been broken. The ACCC may also make recommendations for changes in the law from its investigations.</p>
<p>Should an enhanced voluntary code be insufficient to change behaviours, a mandatory code of conduct could be introduced, with an Ombudsman's role that goes beyond dispute resolution as described in <a href="#h2_11"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></a>.</p>
<div>
<h4>Recommendation 10 </h4>
<p>DIISRTE will work, in consultation with the ACCC and with industry bodies to increase industry awareness of the authorisations process for mergers and collective bargaining under the <em>Competition and Consumer Act 2010</em> (CCA) as a means of achieving economies of scale and cost reductions through mergers, acquisitions, asset sharing, and collective bargaining.</p>
</div>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Processed food manufacturers, especially those in high-volume, low-value sectors that are experiencing difficult trading conditions, could seek larger economies of scale to balance power relationships or utilise collective bargaining provisions available under the <em>Competition and Consumer Act 2010</em> (CCA).</p>
<p>As outlined in <a href="#h2_11"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></a>, industry feedback has suggested the sharing of assets has not progressed because independent legal advice suggests that these initiatives would be seen by ACCC as restricting industry capacity and hence would not be allowed. The key issue here is section 50 of the CCA which prevents any mergers and acquisitions that would significantly lessen competition.</p>
<p>Collective bargaining under the CCA is an arrangement under which two or more competitors in an industry come together to negotiate terms and conditions (which can include price) with a supplier or a customer.</p>
<h5>Recommendation</h5>
<p>It is possible that merger cases which potentially fail the 'substantial lessening of competition' test (in section 50) could be allowed to proceed on the grounds of public interest. That is, an authorisation application might have been made successfully under section 95AU. It should also be noted that the ACCC's Merger guidelines 2008 allows businesses that want to informally explore proposed mergers, acquisitions or asset sharing to have a confidential 'fire-side' chat with the ACCC:</p>
<div>
<p>'If merger parties believe their merger proposal will meet the notification threshold, they are encouraged to approach the ACCC on a confidential and informal basis as soon as there is a real likelihood that the merger may proceed to discuss possible competition issues and options for having the matter considered.'<sup><a href="#fn_276" id="fnr_276">276</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p>Currently, there are only isolated instances of food manufacturers using the collective bargaining provisions of the CCA to help reduce their input costs which, as <a href="#h2_10"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></a> has demonstrated, are significant. Manufacturers, especially SMEs, should be encouraged to explore this option as a potentially important means of reducing costs.</p>
<h3 id="h3_34">5.5 Summary</h3>
<p>No doubt Australian food and beverage manufacturers will continue to struggle with the high value of the Australian dollar for the foreseeable future, as well as Australia's comparatively small market, and the relatively high cost of inputs. However, the Australian processed food sector also has the capacity, capability and opportunity to become a 'food superpower in Asia' in the coming decades.<sup><a href="#fn_277" id="fnr_277">277</a></sup></p>
<p>'Innovation is the key to making Australia more productive and more competitive. It is also fundamental to answering the challenge of climate change, the challenge of national security, the age-old challenges of disease and want.</p>
<p>The strategies recommended in this chapter are, in large part, aimed at building and supporting innovation. The other recommendations are focussed on making sure regulation is not stifling business productivity and that it is effective and efficient. The recommendations are also aimed at making sure businesses are well-informed and supported when looking to expand through export markets.</p>
<p>The strategies focussed on innovation support collaboration between public research institutions and Australian processed food manufacturing businesses as well as making sure government support services are more strategic and coordinated. Part of this is making sure businesses are fully informed and can more easily access Government programs and services.</p>
<p>When it comes to innovation and emerging technologies, it is recommended that there be greater engagement across Government and with the Australian public. Any further adoption of emerging technologies by businesses within the sector would be better supported by an educated and well-informed populace. Similarly, greater transparency and clarification of what Australian made means will mean that processing firms selling Australian products are able to fully capitalise on that brand and the Australian public can be more confident in their choice to buy Australian made.</p>
<p>The current design of government and industry food related regulation is often criticised for being inefficient and adding significant costs to industry, for instance, regulation of food processing and safety. Government programs designed to support the sector also often lack sufficient scale to provide long-lasting economic benefits. Some programs also appear to be designed in isolation, ignoring the potential benefits of greater design integration with existing programs and with little firm-level information to improve efficiency and effectiveness. There appears therefore to be potential to improve the design of both regulation and government programs, reducing costs to business and delivering improved, collaborative and more long lasting economic benefits.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of marketplace relations, Australian food and beverage manufacturers operate in a highly competitive environment with large retailers seeking to drive a hard bargain. The strategies recommended in this chapter, among other things, seek to improve relations between retailers and processors, and seek to increase industry awareness of opportunities and processes that may be available to them to achieve economies of scale through, for instance, asset sharing.</p>
<p>Whether it be through working with public research institutions and universities to create greater linkages between industry and researchers or working closely with Government in identifying regulatory or program inefficiencies that are impeding industry efforts, industry has a pivotal role in all of the strategies.</p>

<p class="footnote-text"><a href="#fnr_272" id="fn_272">272</a> For example, Datamonitor survey May-June 2011 examined the likelihood of domestic consumers' purchasing decisions being influenced by country of origin claims. While the survey indicated that consumers 'preferred' Australian made goods, the study found no evidence that this is a key factor in the purchasing decision i.e. interest in local claims does not necessarily translate into purchase behaviour. Consumers took into account mostly price when making the actual purchasing decision.</p>
<p class="footnote-text"><a href="#fnr_273" id="fn_273">273</a> AFGC's pre- Budget submission 2012 year proposed reviewing Brand Australia to consider how well it currently supports the food and grocery sector and specifically suggest a four part promotion of Australian products overseas based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>provenance - unique, remote and pristine food production areas;</li>
<li>premium quality - quality ingredients and advanced manufacturing technologies;</li>
<li>assured safety - best regulatory system in the world - government certification; and</li>
<li>environmentally sustainable - low impact, highly efficient agriculture and manufacturing.</li>
